Open your Directory Sync configuration page and confirm which attributes you are including during the sync.

I have a question - we use Office365 and VMware View (Horizon) with instant clones. This means that a new W10 machine is created every time you log in and destroyed every time you log out.
However, we have the problemthat we have to authenticate ourselves to Cisco Duo (outlook etc.) with a username and password every time we log in. We federated the domain to Duo. Can anyone tell me if this is “normal” from experience? It is very annoying that the users have to log in to Horizon and then again to Office and that there is no clean SSO.

We have an internal PKI that all computers get a certificate from. Those certificates are in the pfx format.
We have five domain controllers we want to put behind the ldap proxy. This is what our [ad_client] looks like:
[ad_client]host=10.0.0.1host_2=10.0.0.2host_3=10.0.0.3host_4=10.0.0.4host_5=10.0.0.5service_account_username=duo_userservice_account_password=duo_user_passwordsearch_dn=DC=contoso,DC=comtransport=ldapsssl_ca_certs_file=contoso.cer
(we really use the FQDN’s for the DC’s, but I can’t use more than 5 url’s in one post)
The first question is what goes in ""ssl_ca_certs_file? I followed the directions here:Knowledge Base | Duo Security
It’s talks about exporting cert from your domain controller but which cert? Each domain controller has 5 certificates each of them with server authentication for the intended purposes. Does it matter which cert? And it looks like you can only have one ""ssl_ca_certs_file, can you combine all of the export DC certs or are we only able to use one? We’ve tried exporting a cert from all of the DC’s and combining them into one cer file, but that doesn’t seem to work.
In the ldap_server_auto section we have the same questions:
[ldap_server_auto]ikey=skey=api_host=api_urlfailmode=secureclient=ad_clientssl_port=5001ssl_key_path=server.keyssl_cert_path=server.pem

It is acting as a radius server, verifying against my AD schema. Logins to the console work flawlessly after some general modifications to the pam.d/login file. Where I’m experiencing issues is with ssh.
When logging in with a valid user (specified by the authconfig settings), I do get prompted by Duo, but my response time is less than 5 seconds in many cases. By the time the Duo app prompts me, ssh has already failed login and prompts me to re-enter my password.
Is there a way to extend the timeout for ssh/Duo?Should I reconsider using SSSD and pam_duo instead of the proxy?

I have a question - we use Office365 and VMware View (Horizon) with instant clones. This means that a new W10 machine is created every time you log in and destroyed every time you log out.

We have an internal PKI that all computers get a certificate from. Those certificates are in the pfx format.
We have five domain controllers we want to put behind the ldap proxy. This is what our [ad_client] looks like:
[ad_client]host=10.0.0.1host_2=10.0.0.2host_3=10.0.0.3host_4=10.0.0.4host_5=10.0.0.5service_account_username=duo_userservice_account_password=duo_user_passwordsearch_dn=DC=contoso,DC=comtransport=ldapsssl_ca_certs_file=contoso.cer
(we really use the FQDN’s for the DC’s, but I can’t use more than 5 url’s in one post)
The first question is what goes in ""ssl_ca_certs_file? I followed the directions here:Knowledge Base | Duo Security
It’s talks about exporting cert from your domain controller but which cert? Each domain controller has 5 certificates each of them with server authentication for the intended purposes. Does it matter which cert? And it looks like you can only have one ""ssl_ca_certs_file, can you combine all of the export DC certs or are we only able to use one? We’ve tried exporting a cert from all of the DC’s and combining them into one cer file, but that doesn’t seem to work.

When logging in with a valid user (specified by the authconfig settings), I do get prompted by Duo, but my response time is less than 5 seconds in many cases. By the time the Duo app prompts me, ssh has already failed login and prompts me to re-enter my password.

62,https://community.duo.com/t/howto-pam-duo-with-ad-integration-via-sssd/1568,HowTo: pam_duo with AD integration via SSSD,Unix and SSH,,gnyce,https://community.duo.com/u/gnyce,9/7/2017,"Thanks to Ryan@Duo for talking through some of this via chat… I was able to figure it out, also reading the approach outlined herehttps://github.com/duosecurity/duo_unix/issues/39(though that approach never worked for me).  I cannot swear that this does not have holes, but it works consistently in every scenario that we use.
TitleHow do I 1) enable pam_duo to use passwords and 2) exclude public key authentication and 3) use both local-accounts (/etc/passwd) as well as SSSD/Kerberos integration with 2FA.
Answer
Setting up Duo Unix (pam_duo) is relatively straightforward from the documentation, and Duo provides an additional help-article athttps://help.duo.com/s/article/ka070000000fzxYAAQ/2231if you want to use passwords.  However, this does not play well if you are using (in our case) SSSD, RedHat’s offering that allows you to integrate with LDAP, AD, and so on (using a Kerberos ticket from your Windows PC will bypass 2FA completely, which we also do not want).  Additionally, we needed to support both AD accounts as well as local-accounts (for our remote-monitoring NOC to login), and we wanted to use 2FA for all involved.
NOTE:  in this setup, the Pubkey exceptions do NOT get prompted for 2FA, but that is how we want it for this setup.  We exclude those accts via the “group” option in pam_duo.conf
Follow the pam_duo instructions athttps://duo.com/docs/duounixbefore making the following configuration changes.
Tested on RHEL6.x
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
PubkeyAuthentication noPasswordAuthentication yesChallengeResponseAuthentication yesUsePAM yesUseDNS no
<snip – go to end of the file>
#editsfor 2FA and any PubKey auth#addany account that IS using public-key authenticationMatch User oracle,gridPubkeyAuthentication yes
#Weare using SSSD ‘ad_access_filter’ to control access,#soneed to turn off GSSAPI Auth for those AD users,#otherwisethey get passed in via Kerberos ticket and no#password-promptOR 2FA challengeMatch Group ssh_console_usersGSSAPIAuthentication no
/etc/pam.d/sshd:  The idea is that with “pam_localuser.so”, if the user trying to login exists in /etc/passwd, skip 1 line to “pam_unix.so” which handles the auth and then falls into “pam_duo” for the 2FA.  If the users does NOT exist in /etc/passwd, fall into “pam_sss.so” (SSSD) which handles the auth and then skips 1 line into “pam_duo” for the 2FA.

/etc/pam.d/system-auth:   basically unchanged fromhttps://help.duo.com/s/article/ka070000000fzxYAAQ/2231but take note how “pam_deny.so” did move positions up.  Here is the top excerpt:

We are excited to share that Duo Level Up is now generally available to all Duo customers! Our release is a huge milestone that would have not been possible without your support. We sincerely thank you for taking the time to test-drive our courses and share your insightful feedback during the Beta Program!
Starting today August 9th, an Admin Panel account is now required to register for courses on Level Up (levelup.duo.com). Learn more about the upcoming changes below!
How to Register for Level Up
As part of our public launch oflevelup.duo.com, we will be retiring registration access codes and moving to a single sign-on (SSO) experience, where administrators can now log in using the same credentials they use to access the Duo Admin Panel.
To connect your Admin Panel account to your Level Up account, you will need to login to the Duo Admin Panel and click theLevel Up: Training & Certificationlink in the bottom left-hand corner of the Duo Admin Panel.
Will my certifications and course progress transfer?
Yes. All of your Level Up activity will remain associated with your account, as long as the email address you used for your Level Up beta account matches the one you use to access the Duo Admin Panel. If you need any assistance with your course progress, contact our team atlevelup@duo.com.
Which email address do I use if I have multiple Duo accounts?
If you have access to multiple Duo accounts, we recommend using the email associated with the account you access most frequently, or the parent account if you manage accounts with a sub-account structure.
How can I register other admins in my organization?
If you’re interested in having other administrators in your organization take our training courses, an Admin Panel account will be required to access Level Up. You can grant them access by creating an Admin Panel account for them. This access is open to all administrator roles, so if you’d prefer that your admins complete training before having access to manage any settings in the Admin Panel, consider giving themRead-Only access.
Will Level Up still be free?
Yes, Level Up will remain free. As part of our mission to make security accessible to everyone, Level Up will remain free and available for all Duo customers, on every paid or free edition of Duo, for every administrator with access to the Duo Admin Panel, with any administrative role.
Thank you for all your support!
Our team will continue to create and improve courses to make our learning experience even better, and will keep sharing the latest updates with you here on the Community. We hope you’ll join us for the next phase of our journey.

The ADFS servers were using the Duo AD FS Adapter version 1.2. We recently upgraded the adapter to version 2 for Universal Prompt Support. Apparently version 2 broke something in the ADFS page /.well-known/openid-configuration   thats needed for vCenter.
I then read and setup Duo SSO and Generic OIDC for vCenter to attempt to use. I followed the same vmware KB articleVMware Knowledge Baseattempting to have Duo SSO/OIDC map the same attributes that ADFS would use. Our Duo Proxy Servers are connected to our Active Directory servers, and not ADFS.  In Duo OIDC application page, I have the openid scope enabled, and manually created a new scope called ‘allatclaims’, and manually mapped these values trying to mimic the ADFS document.
Token-Groups - Qualified by Long Domain Name  → GroupUser-Prinicipal-Name  → Name IDUser-Prinicipal-Name → UPN
Here are the VMware KB’s i’ve used to setup ADFS
Configure vCenter Server Identity Provider Federation for AD FS
After installing or upgrading to vSphere 7.0 or later, you can configure vCenter Server Identity Provider Federation.
https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
What happens is, I log into vCenter web interface, I enter my username, I get redirected to Duo SSO, enter Username, Password, MFA and get redirected back to vCenter UI page with a [400] Unable to authenticate. error message.
vCenter logs shows a message of ""Csp responded with status 400 BAD_REQUEST and body {“error_title”: “invalid_request”, “error_message”: “Request was malformed”}
The error of Request was malformed leads me to think that maybe we’re not mapping the correct values in the OIDC webpage.
Is there plans to support either fix the ADFS Duo 2.0 Adapter or Support vCenter using OIDC? Otherwise I’ll likely have to revert the Universal Prompt on ADFS Adapter 2.0 and use 1.2",0

I’ve been attempting to move to the Universal Prompt for years, but there has always been technical blockers.  With the announcement that support for the Traditional Prompt is ending in the coming months, I’m growing in concern that gaps I’ve called out haven’t been addressed.  In particular, the lack of support for the user to select a Default Device.  I’ve opened support cases that have been closed/added to an enhancement, but haven’t heard of a solution being developed.
The Universal Prompt is not available at every integration point (LDAPS/RADIUS authentication proxy) and in real world deployment users are not prompted at all, or using an unexpected method (some of which can’t work). This is a huge gap we found when attempting to roll out the Universal Prompt that produced Incidents which forced us to roll back to the Traditional Prompt. It appears the Universal Prompt work fails to address anything other than Universal Prompt behaviors. For us, this is a must have before the we can move to Universal Prompt because we use other options like LDAP/RADIUS proxies, and CLI integration.
Based on the language in the guide, it’s like the team is fully aware that default devices were removed compared to the Traditional Prompt but don’t understand this is a problem.
https://guide.duo.com/universal-prompt(Language as-of 2023-01-26)
“Completing Duo login sets the login option you used as the first choice for this application. Future Universal Prompt logins to that applicationfrom the same device and browser will automatically use that same method. If you cancel the authentication in process and choose a different device, then the device you use becomes the first choice for that application.
“There is no way to turn off automatic device selection, or to explicitly configure a default authentication device.
“Your organization’s Duo administrator may choose to block some authentication options for certain applications, requiring that you choose a different device. Since Duo remembers the last-used authentication device for each application you access,the Universal Prompt should always display the right default option for that application.”
You can see this is fully Universal Prompt centric and does not address or acknowledge any behavior or impacts to other integration/prompt use cases using Duo.
How can we raise this issue to the right level of attention?
Thank you.Anthony",1

When we attempt to upgrade the Netscaler to version 13.1 Build 24.38 (released on 06/07/22), we receive the following errors related to DUO:
The following configuration lines will get errors in 13.1 and both they and dependent configuration will be removed from the configuration:

We verified that the configuration lines above are the exact lines mentioned in theDUO Netscaler configuration doc. All is running well using that configuration on Netscaler version 13.0.
Do these lines need to be rewritten/reformated for compatibility with Netscaler 13.1 Build 24.38? Or any other suggestions regarding these errors?
We are unable to upgrade until the rewrite policy commands are formatted properly.

Any idea how/why duo_unix has appeared in EPEL (with a later version than duosecurity has) and why it’s way smaller in size and doesn’t function?

There is a unique opportunity this year at Cisco Live in the Meeting Zone. Cisco Secure User Experience (UX) teams are hosting interactive sessions to learn about customers’ challenges and needs on topics like risk, SSE, and more. These conversations are opportunities for you to influence Cisco’s future product development decisions. User experience teams are looking for people to participate in hands-on interactive 60-minute design thinking sessions. Sessions are available February 6 through February 9 throughout the day.Read more about the sessions and sign up using the links below!
Questions? Let us know at:sbg-experience-innovation-lab@cisco.com.
Session topics:
Risky Business: Build your ideal risk score
Risky Business: Build your ideal risk score
In this interactive workshop, security practitioners will explore the factors they think of when assessing and measuring risk. If Cisco Secure had a universal risk score for their security products, what would that score look like? Feedback from this session will inform many products across Cisco Secure.

We have different portals, each with it’s own URL and access restrictions, which have been created to limit what parts of the internal network a given user has access.  So Internal users from VendorA might only be able to access Vlan10 and users from VendorB might only be able to access Vlan11.
We do this by using a single Windows NPS server with mulitple policies.  Fortigate allows you to specify a NAS-IP parameter in each Radius request.  Normally this would be the IP of the Fortigate, but the NAS-IP can be anything (even a string which is not an IP address).  Each vendor has a specific policy on the NPS server then which matches the NAS IP (which represents that vendor), and an AD group that maches that vendor,  for a user to sucessfully authenticate.
Authentication requests for internal users, to our internal users portal, are authenticated via a Duo proxy.  We now have a requirement to use MFA for vendor access as well.  As far as I know each Duo proxy includes only one AD group or list of AD groups, and that Duo proxy will only check group membership in that group or list of groups.
I need a way to pass a parameter like NAS-IP, or some other Radius VSA to the Duo proxy, then have the Duo proxy check if the NAS-IP is say 1.1.1.1, then the user request must a member of AD group VendorA.  While if the Radius request has NAS-IP 2.2.2.2, then the user request must be a member of AD group VendorB.
If I have to put all my vendor accounts into the same group and have the Duo proxy check for group membership in that common vendor group, then I no longer have a way to prevent VendorA from attempting to login tohttps://my.company.com/VendorBportal and vise-versa.  We currently have about 12 vendor portals defined and that is expected to grow, so having a dedicated Duo proxy per vendor portal isn’t a scalable solution.
Is there some other way to solve this problem with Duo?  I was wondering about having the user authenticate via Radius first to the NPS (to check for correct group membership, then doing a defer to Duo for MFA.  I’ve set that up with Azure, but not with Duo and am not sure how/if that would work.  If that is even possible, then Duo would only need to handle the MFA part of the authentication request and not be concerned with AD group membership.",0

DNSSEC is now configured forFederal edition customer deployments
DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) strengthens authentication by cryptographically signing DNS data, allowing DNS resolution to verify that data received matches the content and origin of the data sent. Most industry security standards encourage or require the use of DNSSEC.By implementing DNSSEC, Duo will strengthen protection from attacker-in-the-middle and cache-poisoning attacks that can result in compromised access to protected applications.DNSSEC is a requirement ofFedRAMP Authorization.

Because our Duo MFA local server is no longer available, we can no longer login to the computer even using the local computer account that was added after the computer was removed from the domain. Duo needs to provide a way to remove the software rather than just bricking the computer unless you want to reinstall Windows. We specifically cannot reinstall Windows because the very reason we need to access this computer now is because it contains one piece of software with one specific file we need to access.

I wanted to pop in here to announce that support for OIDC and OAuth 2.0 in Duo SSO will begin rolling out to customers starting on December 1st.
Take a look at our announcement blog + share with your friends and network! →OpenID Connect (OIDC) Support in Duo SSO in Early Access | Duo Security
Starting in our D255 release (December 1st), we will be adding 3 new integration types to the product. You can read more in the documentation linked below:
Generic OIDC Relying Party- Protect web-based applications using the OIDC Authorization Code Flow. We have early access customers protecting applications including DNSFilter and Datto!
Single Sign-On for Generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) Relying Parties
Add two-factor authentication (2FA) to any OpenID Connect (OIDC) application with Duo Single Sign-On.
OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials- Generate Access Tokens for Machine-to-Machine Authorization
Single Sign-On for OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
Protect OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials applications with Duo Single Sign-On.
Epic Mobile Applications- Enables customers to protect login and EPCS workflows in Epic’s Haiku, Canto, and Rover mobile applications.
Single Sign-On for Epic Mobile Apps
Add two-factor authentication (2FA) to Epic Mobile Apps with Duo Single Sign-On.
There is much more to come around Duo SSO’s support for OIDC and OAuth 2.0, both leading up to GA and after with Refresh Token Support and AuthCode + PKCE in the pipe!
If you have any feedback during the Early Access period, please let us know or feel free to fill out theFeedback Form.

Recently we upgraded DUO Splunk connector 1.1.9 on Splunk to 9.0.0.1 using the same application setting (skey, ikey, api host).    It works when first enabled, however, it stops collecting logs after running less than 60 minutes, with message, e.g.

Using PAM for DUO and remote logins (the password-auth stack basically) and also for system-auth. My question is this, any way to set two different pam_duo.conf behaviors? So that ppl coming in via ssh for example would getfailmode = securebut connections to our management network and consoles, arguably a touch more secure could getfailmode = safe?
I 've got both bypassing local users (for now? or forever? Who knows?) but Duo prompting AD accounts.
Without using the login_duo approach (it seems disfavored, right?) since Pam is the recommendation according to the docs, "" We recommend deploying thepam_duomodule in most scenarios""
And I think it would be more streamlined to boot if possible

we have a customer that has an RDS Farm accessible from the internet via an RDWeb/RDGateway portal.They’ve installed Microsoft’s webclient to provide seamless signon using Chrome/Edge (only IE provides seamless signon with their activeX plugin fopr the classic portal) and also from Apple Macs
In the past Duo RDWeb/RDGateway agents didn’t work with the webclient. Is this still the case?
If it’s still not working, are their any plans to provide this functionality? More and more organisations are moving to the webclient now that IE is dead, so was wondering if this is now working?

Got a requirement to provide MFA to Google Workspace (google mail, Google Classroom, etc)Looking atDuo Single Sign-On for Google Workspace (Google G Suite) | Duo Securityit says that the first steps are to configure Duo Single Sign-on and configure a working Authentication Source. Unfortunately this is a bit confusing top me.
When I go to configure an Authentication Source, it gives me the option of Active Directory or SAML.
It says that this configuration is for first-factor credentials. does that mean I need to configure AD for first factor, then SAML for 2nd Factor to secure my Google Workspace? Or do I just need to configure SAML idP to use Duo with Google Workspace, as I’ve already got the Google Cloud Directory Sync installed on my domain controllers to allow users to use their domain accounts with Google classroom?
Additionally I’ve already got an Active Directory source configured for my DirSync, to sync users up to Duo Portal.Will it automatically use this if necessary, or do I have to explicitly create a new Authentication source just for SSO?
If I have to create a new Active Directory Authentication Proxy, do I then need to have 2 installed in my domain, one for standard dir sync and one for SSO?
After that is done, I then need to configure SAML as the “second-factor”?
very confused…

I’m an administrator of a group of schools in a Multi-Academy Trust, but each school has it’s own Active Directory which is not linked together.The Duo Portal I have is NOT a Multi-tenancy portal where I can set up individual accounts for each school. It’s basically a “single organisation” portal that I need to use for each school.
I need to be able to use Directory Sync for each school to upload each schools users into their own separate user groups so the users don’t mix amongst each other
If I use Directory Sync for multiple schools in this type of Duo account, will it get confused seeing different accounts from different active directory environments?
Can i still assign different “administrators” to the different AD / Dir Sync “groups”?
Thanks and regards

Unfortunately when she opened the DUO Mobile app, she found her Instagram account is “disabled”. In order to reconnect, she of course needs to log into Instagram… but she can’t do that without the 2fa code. Quite the frustrating conundrum we’ve found ourselves in!

I sell a web-based application for customers to install on their own websites.  It has its own internal user database and authentication + 2fa methods, where the 2fa includes the typical options like webauthn, yubiotp, etc.  Sometimes customers request technical support, and as a result must add one or more of our staff as a user in their own copy of the software.  Upon login our staff should add a 2fa method, upon completion of the support request our staff are supposed to ask the customer to delete the user account they’d created for support, and then we of course hope the customer does so.  These are three steps all subject to human error.
We would like to ensure there is no situation where such an account could sit there dormant to later be used in an unauthorized manner.  The idea is that since we already use Duo for MFA, we could release an update for our software that forces any account ending in our email domain to go do the second factor at Duo rather than one of the internal methods.  Then, even if an account is left around, and later has its password compromised, the login would only succeed if the account is also still present and active in Duo, and the bad actor is able to complete the Duo second factor for that particular employee.  This would put a stop to access by terminated accounts, those whose second factor was stolen and updated on our side, etc.
We thought Duo’s Web SDK was the way to go but the secret key you’re issued seems to be able to create users in Duo.  Obviously we can’t bundle that into the software and distribute it.  We were hoping it was more like an SSH public key where having possession of it just means you could add it to other apps without authorization, but it wouldn’t compromise Duo or existing apps since they’d be using different keys.
Any ideas?  Thanks!",0

Is it because Federal edition  "" .duofederal.com/auth/v2/preauth""  doesn’t have the particular endpoint so we are not getting any response or getting exception as above

Most of our servers act as Remote Desktop Session hosts, and in testing I’ve found that Duo prompts for both full Remote Desktop sessions as well as RemoteApp sessions.  Now the obvious solutions is to make a bypass policy for the application and an enforce policy for the administrative group which I have done and works fine.
However I’m trying to plan ahead for when we want to protect RemoteApp and Remote Desktop logons for all users.  I’m concerned that I won’t be able to differentiate between the two types of traffic in Duo for creating policies that differ between applications.

I am running into the following issue using the Duo Admin API with Postman. When I run a GET request such as the following, I get an HTTP status code of 200 and a valid response.
https://{{duo-API-HOST}}/admin/v1/users?username=xxx.yyy
When instead of the actual username I use a variable in the request URL, which resolves to the same username (when hovering over with the mouse, as seen in the following screenshot)I get the following error:code: 40103message: Invalid signature in request credentials
I am confused as to why one request with the username value works and the same request with the identical username passed as a variable value does not.
Is this a Postman-specific issue? I am using the Pre-Request Script at the end of this post. Could it be that the reason for the invalid signatures is that the “params” used for construction of the signature do not actually use the resolved key=value pair (i.e. username=xxx.yyy) but the unresolved key=value pair (such as username={{username}})?
Thanks in advance for you help!

They use Windows Hello and therefore can logon and/or unlock using password, PIN, fingerprint or face. The laptop locks after 5 minutes of being idle. MFA is implemented but this only kicks in when logging into a new device/password changed etc.
This has been deemed not secure enough and they want to implement additional 2FA authentication via mobile phone. The requirement is simple - upon authenticating using Windows Hello (logon or unlock) and 24 hours has expired, require an additional authentication step via their mobile phone.
We’ve done a trial of Duo and it wasn’t ideal as it turned off Windows Hello and resorted to forcing the users to re-enter their password each time they unlocked the screen. Feedback was that this really was too user-unfriendly.

The documentation from the vendor is written in the context of Terminal Services which has no relation to streaming 1000 read only images from a single virtual disk (vhdx).
Almost all of these types of agents whether anti-virus or whichever require a unique installation switch or a “seal script” modification to compensate for the base image having one unique name but then spinning up read-only instances in RAM where each instance has it’s own unique name, IP, MAC so on and so forth.
This might be a specific regkey or value wipe, INI file modification, so forth but it is almost never as simple as installing the agent to the base image and cross your fingers.
It is one thing to deploy the client to a single server OS but this is more like Z-Linux where you have one base image that has one name, one IP, MAC and all that I’ve stated and when these boot up they get a DHCP Address where MAC reservations are static and I’m using a boot drive partition as opposed to PXE/TFTP or ISO Boot.
The vendor documentation references Terminal Services which has zero relation to a Citrix VDA image with TS Enabled but spinning read-only instances of that one image to RAM and each having their own unique identifiers.  I’m already seeing issues just having it installed in the base image so I can’t help but wonder what will happen when we start spinning up read only iterations of that base image?
I can’t seem to find anything relative on Google or this forum or Reddit related to DUO 2 factor MFA installed to the Citrix VDA in order to use this for MFA on other internal hosted applications such as SAP and SAS and JDA where the entire company must go through Citrix first to access any business application.
100% Citrix environment split between two data centers and active/active.  NetScaler SDX (4 at each DC).  I’m somewhat dependent on the consultants hired to assist with the implementation but they do not seem to have a clue relative to what Citrix PVS is and how it is exceptionally unique.

234,https://community.duo.com/t/globalprotect-connect-before-logon/11022,GlobalProtect,Connect Before Logon | VPN,,jwckauman,https://community.duo.com/u/jwckauman,11/30/2021,"Palo Alto’s VPN solution GlobalProtect is configured in Duo as a protected application and in the Palo Alto firewall as a SAML authentication provider.   GlobalProtect connects perfectly if the user signs into Windows first and then connects GP.  GP doesn’t complete the connection process if the user attempts to connect the VPN BEFORE they sign into Windows.  From a process-standpoint, here’s what we are seeing…
At the Windows lock screen, the user clicks the GlobalProtect ‘Connect’ option first.
GP opens an embedded browser window and prompts the user for their Azure AD account and password, which they enter and click ‘Sign-On’.
Duo passes creds to Azure AD for authentication succesfully and that first window closes.
A second window opens which is normally where Duo would prompt for MFA.  Instead, the user sees nothing but a blank window (GlobalProtect is shown in the title bar).
NOTE: I don’t see anything in the Duo logs to suggest GlobalProtect reached out to Duo so I suspect the issue is with the script/code that makes that connection happen (and shows the Duo MFA prompt).  Maybe an issue with the script not being able to run prior to sign-on?  What could we do to troubleshoot?",0

In a DAP protecting Microsoft Office 365 with a federated domain, does DUO support temporary AD passwords?
For example, if an admin changes a user’s AD password, are they then able to check the box reading “User must change password at next logon” so that the user will be able to choose themselves a new password when logging in to Office 365?
The underlying AD is already syncing passwords to/from Office365.
This is working fine when the user logs in via the Cisco Anyconnect VPN client but wondering if this can work logging into Office 365 as well

Hello all,Creating a topic here to possibly get some help on an issue we’ve been running into using Duo MFA and macOS.
We are deploying Duo through Jamf and we have no issues using the automated enrollment for Mac users that are in office. Our issue is with the Mac users that work remote. As i understand it by default macOS will not allow you to select or change wifi networks from the login screen. This causes conflicts with Duo to where a user is unable to login to the Mac because it is not connected to the internet and it will block a user from logging in, We have it set to enroll them into offline access as well, but this will not prompt them to do so until after they complete the 1st initial authentication while online.All of our Macs are on the latest software at the time of writing, 12.5.1 and we are using MacLogon-2.0.0.pkg being installed through a policy in Jamf Pro.
If we install Duo on a Macbook then ship it to a remote user, it is essentially a paper weight that they can’t login to or connect to the internet with.Has anyone else ran into this issue or found an alternative way of deploying Duo to Macs ?Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you",0

But I have to ask. Here’s why.Some time ago, I tested IsDecicions Userlock as MFA solution. All fine and dandy. But: it only protects access to thepcthat has the Userlock client installed. In other words; it does NOT prohibit someone from logging on to a (Windows) domain. So if you happen to know the logon credentials of a domain user, then just bring you own pc, without Userlock client, connect it to the network, browse to a server and when it asks for logon credentials, just type in username and password and you’re in. Not exactly what I had in mind.

Or at least a radial button in the Duo Admin Portal under Settings to DISABLE the option of Bypass Mode altogether?
We have many systems administrators in our organization, each responsible for a branch of the organization. They need to be able to manage the users under their branch (hence the User Manager role). However, we have a strict enterprise policy of not allowing any user to be able to bypass Duo. They can get a temp bypass code no problem but we don’t want them to be able to bypass mfa.
For now our workaround is to use a Splunk integration which triggers a script to reset a user to Active based on a Duo bypass mode event. Sometimes this can take a few minutes to execute the workflow and reset the user back to ACTIVE and that window of time is too long for our desired security posture.

On June 2, 2022, we will update the GPG key used to signDuo Unixdistribution packages to improve the strength and security of our package signatures. If you are currently using this application, the next time that you upgrade the Duo Unix package on or after June 6th via yum, dnf, apt, or apt-get, you will also have to update the key.
Depending on which distribution of Unix you are using, you will need to run the following command during the application upgrade process to update the GPG key.
CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)rpm --import https://duo.com/DUO-GPG-PUBLIC-KEY.asc
Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 and Debiancurl -s https://duo.com/DUO-GPG-PUBLIC-KEY.asc | sudo apt-key add -
Ubuntu 22.04:curl -s https://duo.com/DUO-GPG-PUBLIC-KEY.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/duo.gpg
These are the same commands that must be run to import Duo’s GPG signing keys for a new installation of Duo Unix.
This key change does not impactdeprecated OS versions such as Debian 8 or CentOS 6.
If you are currently running Duo Unix and try to upgrade to the latest version without updating the GPG key, you will see an error similar to the following.
Example error when using apt update
W: GPG error: https://pkg.duosecurity.com/Debian jessie Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY …

Pre-request Script for HTTP requestsThe Duo APIs use HTTP Basic Authentication. The password value expected with each request is a hash of several concatenated request elements. Due to the dynamic nature of the HTTP Basic Authentication value needed for each request to the API, additional configuration is needed within Postman. Postman provides the ability to execute Javascript code prior to the HTTP request being sent. This is accomplished using the Pre-request Script setting within each HTTP request.
Before sending a request it calls the javascript for HTTP Basic Authentication.

I’ve got an instance of a Google Workspace LDAP server. We’re a small organisation, and it’s worked well for us in the past. We have had OpenVPN authenticating happily directly to Google’s LDAP and I thought we could put Duo’s auth proxy in the middle in order to get a 2FA prompt.
Google’s LDAP service is perhaps a little more complicated than others I’ve encountered. In order to use it correctly, you generate a “Client” and get a set of certificates that you use to connect that client. If you need the equivalent of a Service account, you generate some “Application Credentials”, which are valid only for that “Client”. If the certificate thing is incompatible with your client, you can utilise sTunnel as a proxy, which takes care of encryption/certificates for you and essentially allows clients to connect as if it’s regular unsecured ldap. I decided to use sTunnel for Duo just to take away that part of the equation.
So my diagram of what’s going on is:
OpenVPN, Auth Proxy and sTunnel are all running on the same machine. My configuration file looks like:
OpenVPN is set upwithouta set of bind credentials, because if Idoput in the access credentials, I get:
This is a bit of a pain. From what I can tell, Google don’t actually give you a bind DN for these service accounts, so I’ve removed the bind account for OpenVPN.
If Idon’thaveexempt_primary_bind = false, I get through no problems - except no 2FA prompt is spawned (and it says excluding primary bind). So I’ve set that to false. If that happens, I get these logs:
From what I can see here, it binds with the authenticating user no problems. Then it tries and binds with a blankdn, and Google returns with AUTH_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED (Secure LDAP service: Error code descriptions - Google Workspace Admin Help). I kind of understand that because there is no DN for that service account - it’s just Google magic for that client.
As I started clutching at straws, I thought I’d use a real account in the Duo auth proxy instead of one of Google’s fake service accounts. I’d really prefernotto do this, as every account in Google costs $ per month, but I thought I’d try anyway.
The config was much the same, but I specifiedauth_type=plainand abind_dnin addition to changing the service account user/pass.
The debug messages are the same up until the binding as a blank user. Logs are below: it gets further, but then it thinks it can’t find theuidof the authenticating user.
Google have an LDAP audit log, and I copied the query the auth proxy appears to be doing (and the base object, which from what I can tell is the authenticating user itself) and did anldapsearch:
As expected, theuidis definitely there. It’s also spewed out in the Auth proxy logs, although I notice there it’s represented as an array (eg.['<authenticating_user>']) rather than a single string value. I also triedgoogleUidandposixUidas they’re all the same (and these all exist in Duo).
I also noticed the “SASL username” outputted as part of the LDAP search and tried to use that as the bind DN in various places (OpenVPN, Auth proxy etc) but alas no luck there.
Has anyone successfully used Duo Auth proxy with Google Workspace LDAP? Is it supported? Is anyone able to give me some pointers? I’d really like this to work.",1

This feature has been working well, but I did have two suggestions:
Let administrations define the number of digits, or reduce the numbers of digits.  I think 6 digits is a little much here as the real purpose of this is to prevent “mindless push acceptance”, which is all too common.  I find 6 digits is more burdensome than necessary.
Not sure if this is possible, but if the push request could default to put the cursor in the number box and have the number pad on screen, that would save the extra tap needed to get to that point.  I realize this would require a re-design of the push screen so you still could easily tap the “I’m not logging in button”.",1

If I just want to auth using the app generated token I still get a push notification to the phone and have to touch on accept. Is there no way to use only one method of MFA, so either a SMS, A token or the push notification?
If I change the policy and only select SMS then how does it work since I can’t put the sms code into the VPN login before I get it, so how does that work?
If I select only Token, then all access fails no matter if the token is correct, If I select only push notifications then what do I put in the VPN login for token, anything? If I select token and push then the token can be incorrect and it does not matter, the connection goes through.
It all seems a bit here and there, is there perhaps a detailed document that explains the options.",0

I’ve recently done testing Duo for RDP. Now I’m moving to implement my configs for some servers in our environment but I’m unable to proceed. Every time I run the installer, on the part where it needs to check connectivity, I’m getting “operation timed out”. Our firewall team already configured rule/s to allow to reach our Duo API URL through 443/80.

Bug fixes
Resolved an issue with Azure Directory Sync. Due to a recent change made by Microsoft to begin requiring multi-factor authentication for some Azure administrator accounts, Duo’s Azure Active Directory sync feature could fail when configured as previously documented. Now, an ""Azure AD Sync Failed"" event will be logged with the reason ""Invalid Access Token,"" and account owners will receive an email instructing them to reauthorize the affected directory.Learn more in this Knowledge Base article.The ""Not Enrolled"" User Count on the Dashboard page no longer includes deleted users.Fixed a bug on the Azure AD directory page whereby the groups being synced could be incorrectly removed (from the directory’s synced groups) if the user saved other changes before the groups were fully loaded. This affected only customers with a very large number of groups in Azure AD.Admin Panel SAML login was always directing the admin to the dashboard after successful login, even if they had tried to load a specific non-dashboard page. This is now fixed so that they are redirected to their intended destination page.

The whole back and forth works great. However, in the very last step where we attempt to exchange the authorization code it just hangs indefinitely.
We don’t need async so we’re just calling as such:idToken = duoClient.ExchangeAuthorizationCodeFor2faResult(code, username).Result
Stepping though the code… once we reach that line above it will just disappear in there and never come back.
Watching the traffic w/ Fiddler (https-decrypting proxy) I see the https tunnel gets setup… but I don’t see any additional traffic taking place.
Any ideas?
I’ve yet to attempt to look through the document on how to make the call outside the library. Guessing there is a rest, etc. call supposed to be happening behind the scenes. I’ll probably look at that as well but it would be great if the library just worked.

I’m totally new to Duo, but I’ve been working as an IT pro for quite a while now. Our organization is exploring the idea of implementing Duo MFA to domain-joined Windows Servers.
I’ve managed to set up a basic environment to initially test how Duo works and everything seems to work. Though I have questions around Authentication Proxy…
From official docs (Authentication Proxy Reference - Duo | Duo Security)“The Duo Authentication Proxy is an on-premises software service that receives authentication requests from your local devices and applications via RADIUS or LDAP, optionally performs primary authentication against your existing LDAP directory or RADIUS authentication server, and then contacts Duo to perform secondary authentication.”-does this mean domain member servers with Duo agent no longer need Internet access?
My initial setup of authentication proxy did not have [ad_client], and everything was working. So, I’m wondering what’s the difference if I add [ad_client]?
The ultimate objective I have in mind is when I roll out Duo to our production environment is to limit limit our servers connecting to the internet, if that’s possible through Authentication Proxy.
I’ve seen thisWhat are the differences between [ad_client] and [radius_client] Duo Authentication Proxy configurations?so I think it’s possible, but I’m not really sure though.",0

I provided the instructions (Duo Two-Factor Authentication for Cisco ASA SSL VPN with Browser and AnyConnect | Duo Security) for them to use in configuring Duo with the proper keys and host info needed.
We tested it and found it would not take the credentials entered. I had the vendor go back over the instructions twice to validate they did not miss any details and they confirmed it.
When authenticating we can see the failures in the Duo panel so it appears it is configured to connect. But after some testing I found odd behavior when authentication with AnyConnect.
If we enter the user ID then the user password, and enter either the passcode or ‘push’ for the secondary, it will fail. I found through some trial and error, if we enter ‘push’ for both the password and secondary password, we get the push notification on the mobile device and we can successfully connect. Obviously not how it should behave.
Does anyone have any suggestions I can pass on to my vendor on where there could be an issue, or what they may have overlooked in the instructions?

It’s to the point where I may have to start looking at other 2FA providers. This is very unfortunate because up until this point, I have had very minimal issues with Duo and I have also received very good support back when I was doing an 802.1x deployment.
Am I the only person who is looking for this feature? Surely there are other Linux heavy environments out there that would LOVE to have this feature. If you also have a need for this feature, I would suggest that you also submit a feature request via Duo’s support system.
Even an answer like, “We plan to implement this feature some time in 2023,” would be more than enough for me.",0

I am hoping you can help.I have Juniper SSL VPN configured via my Duoproxy server to validate domain login for use with the VPN.
This all works well besides for one aspect
My VPN attempts to reconnect/re-auth between 6-7hrs into the sessionand it failsMy assumption is that because it doesn’t get the username and password initial prompt Duo doesn’t allow the re-validation to occur which causes my VPN connections to drop.
I recall seeing somewhere ( i unfortunately cannot find the resource now so am turning to you) That there is a setting that can be used in the authproxy.cfg file that will tell duo to only prompt once per session,I would like to test this setting with my VPN to see if it alleviates the connection drops.

All three showed the same TOTP value initially, but if I generate a TOTP code in the middle of a time interval (the standard is 30 seconds, so wait until say 15 or 45 seconds past the minute) 1Password and Google Authenticator show I have just a few seconds left while Duo Mobile says I have the full 30 seconds.
I waited until 1Password and Google Authenticator changed the displayed TOTP code, tried to use the code shown in Duo (which matches the code previously shown by 1Password and Google Authenticator), and it failed as an incorrect token.

I know in the past (looks like more than a year ago) it was asked if there were any plans for a lock screen prompt.  At the time, the answer was no.  And it seems that the MacOS guide also mentions that it will not prompt.
Are there any plans or mods/plugins to enable this feature?  Not having Duo prompt for credentials upon lock or a screensaver completely defeats the purpose of having 2FA.  I work for a company that deals with a lot of government customers and we have very strict guidelines that must meet NIST requirements.  2FA for Macs is one of them.  However, we need an enterprise solution, not the BS apple provides (2FA using a personal AppleID doesn’t cut it). I’ve scoured the web to try and find an easy solution – there isn’t one that comes close to Duo (in fact, there really aren’t that many).  We already use Duo on the Windows side heavily and we LOVE it.  We are so close to making Duo our one-stop shop for 2FA across the enterprise!  Is there any way Duo can be customized or modified to make this change?
Thank you.",0

First time poster, go easy!
I am using load balancer to load balance RDGW traffic however the source IP reported to DUO is always from the internal IP address of the Load Balancer. Has anyone got this configured so that the external source IP is correctly reported to DUO?
I hope I’ve been clear enough with my question

Not sure if there is an answer for this , but here goes. We have implemented DUO MFA for Windows logon in our environment. This has been working very well.
We are starting to roll it out to areas that do not have the best cell reception if at all.  We do have a guest network, but this requires users to go to a Barracuda login page. To try and make it easier, we’re kicking around the idea of putting an exception on the Baracuda to allow all traffic for DUO through without having to sign into the network.
My issue is, I don’t know what IP/address the mobile app uses to communicate with DUO.
Does anyone else have any insight?

The users are preferred not to have any personal cell phones on them so we were thinking of just created AD account with or without email, haven’t decided yet.
1st option:would be assign them hard tokens but if they don’t have email it could be problematic having them enroll in Duo.
2nd option would be that they could share a company phone interchanging it between shifts. I did test this on Duo with a test account and it is possible to have 2 accounts on 1 number.

I’ve set up duo on my iPhone and added dozens of websites/banks.
I have three phones and an iPad due to my work. I need to log in to this duo account on these other devices too - however, when I open duo on the new devices there is no ability to log in to my existing account - and when I go to my existing account I realize it’s not even registered to an email, I literally just downloaded the app and started adding things.
I think I’m probably going about this completely the wrong way? I’ve set a ‘reset password’ but it’s not even linked to an email from what I can see so I’ve no idea how this would work if I actually did lose my phone,

Duo will not revert attribute changes applied to synced users when a sync is canceled.

416,https://community.duo.com/t/more-info-about-d241-duo-authentication-proxy-update/12411,More info about D241 Duo Authentication Proxy update,Authentication Proxy,,timshores,https://community.duo.com/u/timshores,6/9/2022,"In D241, Duo released version 5.7.1 of the Duo Authentication Proxy. Please note that this includes patches for two vulnerabilities that result from the third-party Pythonipaddresslibrary.
A first vulnerability rated as critical risk resulted from mishandled IP address strings [CVE-2021-29921]. A second vulnerability rated as medium risk resulted from improperly computed hash values in IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes [CVE-2020-14422]. These vulnerabilities could allow unintended bypass of access controls or expose an application to a denial of service attack.
Duo fixed bothipaddressvulnerabilities inAuthentication Proxy version 5.7.1, released May 26, 2022, by updating to Python 3.8.12 and replacing the third-party library with thePython Standard Libraryipaddress.
Duo always recommends running the latest versions of software to take advantage of security fixes and the latest features. Refer tothis Duo Knowledge Base articleon how to determine your Authentication Proxy version. If you use the Authentication Proxy withAWS Quick Start, you are already running the latest version and do not need to update.
A third vulnerability rated as high risk remains unresolved in Authentication Proxy 5.7.1. This vulnerability results from the third-party Python framework Twisted version 21.2.0, which parses HTTP requests without validating that the requests conform to the RFC 7230 standard [CVE-2022-24801]. This vulnerability exposes HTTP requests handled by the Authentication Proxy to HTTP smuggling exploits that attempt to bypass access controls. The Authentication Proxy is vulnerable to this risk of exploit only if configured to usehttp_proxy.
The Duo Authentication Proxy team is preparing to upgrade to Twisted version 22 for an upcoming software release. The Twisted version 21.2.0http_proxyvulnerability will remain high-risk until Duo releases a fix in an upcoming version of Authentication Proxy. We will announce the release in theDuo Community Release Notes.
A fourth vulnerability rated as high risk remains present in Authentication Proxy 5.7.1, but the Authentication Proxy team has confirmed that the Authentication Proxy does not use vulnerable RSA decryption API code, and concludes that the Authentication Proxy is not exposed to this high-risk vulnerability. This vulnerability results from the Python librarypython-cryptographyversion 3.2, which is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing attacks [CVE-2020-25659]. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit the RSA decryption API to decrypt RSA ciphertext. The potential threat is unintended access to encrypted session data. A directpython-cryptographylibrary update is not an option due to OpenSSL dependencies on this library, so the Authentication Proxy team is researching the long-term resolution.

Server 2019,Microsoft,,GeorgeK,https://community.duo.com/u/GeorgeK,5/17/2022,"We allow customers to access applications using Citrix Remote Apps.
We protect applications using Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP.
Duo prompts for 2 factor on the first connection. But once someone is already logged in another person can “steal” the session or reconnect to an already disconnected (but still logged in) session without any further 2 factor prompts. The user needs to be fully logged out to be secure.
This has been going on for a long time and the later versions haven’t fixed anything. We have customers that now want 2 factor so I’ve been tasked with looking into it again.
Server 2019 did not have the problem before 1803 (I believe) which is when I know there was an issue with Microsoft’s “Automatic Reconnection” but I followed all the mitigation steps with no luck. It definitely used to work a few years ago on 2019.Server 2012r2 does not have the same issue.

I was testing Duo AlmaLinux9 (RHEL 9 derivative) and found an issue with the Duo RPM registry. After getting some help from AlmaLinux community, I found out that that AlmaLinux9 (and presumably other RHEL9 derivatives) have disabled SHA1 signatures by default, which Duo uses.
I’m going a bit off the road with this one because there’s not an official Duo build for EL9 yet (hope there is). I’m actually using the EL8 builds for an EL9 distro.
The issue presents like this:
The work-around is pretty straight forward:
To return the system to a normal state:
Additionally, you need to installcompat-openssl11so pam_duo.so will work
The true fix is to update the repository signature keys to use SHA256 instead of SHA1, as well as producing a build for EL9 systems. Unfortunately that means rolling the keys. If Duo/Cisco has plans to do so, I’d like to know since this is a disruptive thing.
In the meantime, I hope this helps others.

Scala: 124, -111, …, 126, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1
Base64 encoded output:C#:      fZFLS8NQEIX/…gugP+fqX4B
Scala: fJFLS8NQEIX/…gugP+fqX4BAAD//w==
The only difference is in the first byte (the remaining bytes are expected due to the unsigned/signed mechanism between C# bytes and Scala bytes), resulting in the first characters in the base64 encode string having a mismatch (J and Z), when I try to replace the first byte to 125 or J to Z then DUO confirms this is valid SAML Request. I’m investigating further into the cause of this discrepancy, however what I’m wondering is is there anything special in DUO’s SAMLRequest validation mechanism? While the other IdPs all work fine with the SAML Request that the new login generates? Any assumption is very helpful. Thanks for your time.",0

Having a problem protecting Sophos UTM.I set up a LDAP proxy and configured the Firewall to use that proxy instead of the old NPS.This works well for the authentication to the VPN portal page. However, when I configure the same for the SSL VPN I authenticate, receive and approve a DUP push but get denied after.In the DUO admin panel I can see the authentication request as completed. There must be some mishap happening between the proxy and the FW.
Any ideas?
Thanks!",1

We have recently implemented Duo and are in the process of testing with a group of our users.   Though one concern I have is I’m not getting responses when I either email in a support question, or, submit a ticket online (after the initial acknowledgement).
Last week, I emailed in a question regarding configuration, and after waiting a day for a response, I called in to talk to someone.   Two days ago, I opened a support ticket online two days ago, and have yet to receive a response on it.   The status still shows Pending Support…
Should I only use phone support?

Preparing to deploy DUO MFA for a remote access VPN (SSTP) based on MS RRAS.Going to install DUO Authentication Proxy on the RRAS VPN server (member of our AD domain), primary authentication method will be Active Directory, planning authentication between the Proxy and AD to be SSPI.
I have read a lot of documentation and it’s still not clear to me, in the above conditions, when DUO Authentication Proxy is going to be a domain joined server and the authentication protocol to be SSPI, is anything else required to be configured to support expired domain accounts’ passwords change during the VPN connection to RRAS server?

Im hoping im in the right group here.
Im looking to create a power automate flow integrated with either PowerApps or power forms to allow users in my network update their profile information such as their phone number and push an activation code to their phones. There would obviously be some checks in place to ensure they are who they say they are but the premise is there. I have some admin users that  manage DUO tickets and it consumes half their day and im looking to maybe help off-set that if there is a means to do so via the DUO api and power automate.
Has anyone done anything of the such here?
Thanks",1

Good day from Singapore,
The following are the reference guides which I have followed.

Reference guide 7: Group Policy Software installation fails - Error 1612Link:https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/637438-group-policy-software-installation-fails-error-1612
I have created a Group Policy Object GPO to install Cisco Duo Security Group Policy MSI Installer in Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter, which is a domain member server, but it failed.
Here are the error messages from Event Viewer in Windows Server:
Windows failed to apply the Software Installation settings. Software installation settings might have its own log file. Please click on the “More information” link.
The install of application Duo Authentication for Windows Logon x64 from policy Deploy Duo Client to Windows server failed. The error was : %%1612
Is it possible that Cisco Duo Security Group Policy MSI installer is incompatible with Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter?
Is it possible that Cisco Duo Security Group Policy MSI installer can only be installed on domain member workstations like Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11?
The following guide keeps mentioning domain member workstations for a total of 4 times.
Reference guide: Duo Authentication for Windows Logon (RDP) - Active Directory Group Policy
Link:Duo Authentication for Windows Logon (RDP) - Active Directory Group Policy | Duo Security
I have a 2nd question. If it is not due to incompatibility issue, could the installation error be due to file and folder names on the centralized software deployment share?
Deployment source: \fileserver1\d\Duo4.2.0\DuoWindowsLogon64.msi
Transforms: \fileserver1\d\Duo4.2.0\duo420-64.mst
I am wondering if the file and folder names listed above could present a problem.
I am looking forward to your replies.
Thank you very much.

NewDuo Device Health applicationverification option for VMWare Workspace ONE and generic integrations used withDuo Trusted Endpoints
VMWare WorkSpace ONEwith Device Health app is now generally available for macOS and Windows. This integration relies on having the Device Health app present on your Workspace ONE-managed endpoints, and provides a certificate-less approach to verifying device trust as part of Duo’s Trusted Endpoints feature. Trusted Endpoints is available on Duo’s Beyond plan.Generic management with Device Health, another recommended replacement for certificate-based integrations, is also generally available. When a user authenticates via the Duo Prompt, Duo will compare device identifiers collected by the Device Health app installed on that endpoint with the identifiers of known Windows and macOS devices uploaded by Duo usingthe new Device API.Note that Duo has announced the end-of-life timeline for certificate-based device trust verification with our Trusted Endpoints feature. Refer tothis Knowledge Base articlefor more information about this timeline and the migration to Trusted Endpoints with Device Health.

The info in this guide will help you educate end-users and make changes to your Duo configuration that will strengthen your defenses against attacks targeting MFA.
Push phishing can occur when a bad actor steals a user’s primary credentials (like a username and password), uses them to log into an environment, and hopes that the user will simply approve the push out of habit, allowing the bad actor through.
Recently, more advanced methods of push phishing have emerged, making protection measures more important than ever.

The issue is, after inputting our username and password on our organisation sign in page, we receive a ‘Oops something went wrong’ message from DUO.This is intermittent, affects different users on different days, seems to resolve itself after a while (hours / days).For example, my account has been affected for the last hour, now it is fine. No config changes, log offs or anything required. It just suddenly starts working again.
The issue affects anything that requires a DUO login. So it will affect Outlook client. It will affect accessingoutlook.office.comvia a web browser – testing both in and out of the corporate network. Different computers, different browsers (Chrome, IE, Opera).
Once this happens, we have no way to fix it and no way of allowing our users to access their email.
At this stage we’ve only protected our Office 365 accounts. We have a hosted AD and Federated with Office 365.
As a test, I created a policy to protect a Citrix app. This seems to work fine, even when I cannot access office apps.
Since I can rule out a user account, a PC or server, a network connection, a browser I am assuming the issue lies with either our Duo access gateway or Office 365 somewhere?
Any help appreciated.

We want to let you know that Duo is discontinuing our phishing tools to focus on multi-factor authentication and device trust features and functionality. On January 20, 2020, thePhishing Campaigns tool in the Duo Admin Panelwill be discontinued. On this date, Duo Access and Duo Beyond customers who purchased their subscriptions prior to November 25, 2019 will no longer be able to start new phishing campaigns from the Duo Admin Panel. The freeDuo Insight phishing toolwill also be disabled on January 20, 2020.
Beginning November 25, 2019, new Duo Access and Duo Beyond customers will not have access to the Duo Phishing Campaigns tool in the Duo Admin Panel. However, they may still use the free Duo Insight phishing tool if they wish.
On January 20, 2020, all data associated with Duo Phishing Campaigns and Duo Insight will become inaccessible. We encourage administrators to export or otherwise save information from their campaigns prior to this date. Additionally, beginning on this date, Duo Administrators with the Phishing Manager role will be unable to access the Duo Admin Panel. When Phishing Managers attempt to log in, they will see an error message informing them to contact their administrator. To enable Phishing Managers to administer Duo in other ways, consider having an Owner-level administrator change them to adifferent Administrative Role.
If you are interested in using a phishing simulator in the future, we recommend that you evaluate other services like the free, open-sourceGophishto determine whether they meet your organization’s requirements.
Focusing on multi-factor authentication and device trust enables us to release and refine new features like theDevice Health Application, which helps administrators control access to applications through the policy system by restricting access when devices do not meet particular security requirements.

I believe the problem lies around Policy and the appropriate settings.  I’ve created an application for Palo Alto GlobalProtect using Single Sign On.  Everything works, the issue is when to ask for the 2nd factor, and when not to…
Currently, not all staff are part of our MFA/2FA solution, and therefore unknown to Duo, so I need to edit the Global Policies “New User Policy”, and the “Authentication policy” respectively.  But it doesn’t seem to work - I’m just not getting the right results.
I’ve set the New User Policy to Allow access without 2FA (Allow users unknown to Duo to pass through without two-factor authentication. Users who exist in Duo and have not enrolled will be required to enroll.)
However this doesn’t fix my issue, as the Authentication Policy trumps the above mentioned settings:
If it’s set to “Enforce 2FA” Users known to DUO are prompted for their second factor; but users who areNOTyet in DUO (who should be bypassed) are being sent through the enrollment process, which at this time it’s not what we want.

We are in the process of migrating from LDAP -> LDAPS, on one of our primary domains.Due to the fact that we dont have an PKI / CA issuer present in the enviroment, we have used Powershell to create a self-signed certificate.docs.microsoft.comNew-SelfSignedCertificate (pkiclient)Use this topic to help manage Windows and Windows Server technologies with Windows PowerShell.
New-SelfSignedCertificate (pkiclient)
Use this topic to help manage Windows and Windows Server technologies with Windows PowerShell.
This also means that in the cert chain, our CA and Certificate is the same / the CA is not present.So we also disabled the “SSL Verify hostname”, on the Directory sync settings page atduo.com
Currently we are facing the issue, that we cant enable LDAPS, since the website reports the error “The directory server credentials were rejected.”In the authproxy.txt logfile, its breaks with an OpenSSL error: “OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [(‘SSL routines’, ‘ssl3_get_server_certificate’, ‘certificate verify failed’)]”
According to DUO´s documentation, we have tried the following:1. Upgrading to the latest DUO build2. Tried with an *.domain.local certificate3. Tried with an DCName.domain.local certificate (https://help.duo.com/s/article/2220?language=en_US)4. Trusted the selfsigned certificate, in the Windows Cert store on the server, where DUO Auth proxy is installed.
So the million dollar question:How can we setup LDAPS from the Auth Proxy -> Domain controller, while using an self signed certificate?",0

First of all I’m sure this has come up frequently so apologies if I’m asking something that has been answered, and I just didn’t find it.      I’m trying to wrap my head around the fail modes, and their relationship with offline mode.
My understanding with failopen and failclose, is they define behavior with the Duo cloud service is not available - Failopen not prompting for MFA, and failclose will deny login.    And my understanding of Offline mode, is the ability to use a passcode when the Duo service isn’t available.
Using RDP as an example, only administrators in our org RDP to servers.  We are good with denying RDP access to servers if Duo is not available, but, still want the ability to login to servers directly via console if there is a need, if Duo is not reachable.  Is this possible?   And does offline mode work if the Duo service is not available?
EDIT:  A related question, we have a couple of accounts that are shared by multiple users.   For these accounts, we’ve associated each users’s phone to those accounts.   How does that work with Offline mode - would each user be able to setup offline acdcess using their phones to use these shared accounts, or, would only one phone/device be able to use it?

All users have Azure AD accounts which were successfully imported into Duo. All users have activated Duo Mobile. Duo Logon is installed on all workstations to lock those workstations. For most users, Duo is working exactly as intended, sending a push notification to their phones and letting them access their accounts as normal.
Three users, however, are receiving “User not enrolled” errors when logging into their workstations without receiving push notifications. I have sent test notifications to their phones which succeeded, sent reactivation SMS messages to their phones and had them verify the activations while I was in a call with them, checked their email addresses, and set aliases for their specific user account names, making sure that those aliases are what the user types in to log into their accounts.
I think what happened is that the original person who set up their workstations gave them local accounts, then set up unconnected Azure accounts for them, meaning that their local user account is not enrolled into Duo, causing the message. Are there any other probable causes for this?",0

I just started using Duo Free to demo the whole system for my admin team. As I was reading the features, I saw that it could be integrated into Google Workspace to act as an MFA there as well.
I currently have Duo set up for Microsoft RDP, mainly for our local computer logins via AD. This is working exactly as I expected and wanted to now have Duo act as MFA for our Google logins. Ideally, when we log into Google it should prompt us for a Duo push (or other methods) very similar to how it prompts us for AD. Our current MFA with Google is just their built-in method. It works fine, but I want to use Duo for both if possible. Did I misunderstand how Duo and Google work together, because I can’t seem to find an install guide to do this. If it is possible, I would be fine with just an install guide

Known incompatibilities withDuo Authentication for macOSand certificate-basedDuo Trusted Endpointsintegrations on macOS 12.3
Apple released macOS Monterey 12.3 on March 14. The new OS version removes Python 2 as a pre-installed scripting library. This dependency change impacts Duo Authentication for macOS and Duo Trusted Endpoints certificate-based integrations on macOS.
Duo Authentication for macOSIf you use or plan to use Duo Authentication for macOS, we recommend that you delay installation of macOS 12.3 until we release version 1.1.1 of Duo for macOS. The current Duo installer is not compatible with macOS 12.3, and new installations will fail. If you update a system that already has Duo Authentication for macOS to the recent 12.3 release, then Duo authentication may not function, allowing users to log in without 2FA. In addition, the uninstall Python script will not work. We are preparing an updated installer to add full macOS 12.3 support.Duo Trusted Endpointscertificate-based integrations on macOSWe recommend that you delay updates to macOS 12.3 on machines using specific certificate-based Trusted Endpoints integrations for macOS until we release a new certificate enrollment script that is compatible with macOS 12.3. After updating to 12.3, Duo device trust new certificate issuance and existing certificate renewals may fail, which can result in blocked authentications.This issue affects the following integrations: theGeneric Certificate DeploymentandManual Certificate Deploymentfor macOS, and theJamf Pro Managed Devicesintegration that relies on certificates rather than theDuo Device Health app.

Change to new user enrollment flow when usingDuo Device Health Application
Introduced a minor change to the new user enrollment flow for the Device Health app. Users can now enroll in Duo and install the Device Health app as a single workflow. Previously, these were separate steps. Learn more in thisDuo Knowledge Base article.Your choice of Device Health policy configuration options will determine the new user enrollment experience for the app.With a policy configuration of “Don’t require users to have the app,” you can now select an option in theDuo Admin Panelpolicy editor to allow users to install the app when they enroll in Duo for the first time via the Duo authentication prompt. Users also have the option to skip the download and do it later. This option to allow users to download the app during enrollment is disabled by default for existing Duo customers.With a policy configuration of “Require users to have the app,” users enrolling in Duo for the first time via the Duo authentication prompt will be prompted to install the Device Health app by default. This setting is not configurable by administrators. Users will not be able to skip the download.

Duo Directory Synchronizationwill now run twice daily
Directory Syncs for Active Directory, Azure AD, and OpenLDAP will now default to running twice per day (every 12 hours), rather than once per day. Administrators may still initiate an on-demand sync from the Admin Panel or programmatically via theDuo Admin API.

Bug fixes
Minor update to the order of policy control evaluation, to provide a consistent experience across all end-user contexts. Note that this change doesnotaffect the result of policy evaluation in cases where multiple policies interact during an authentication attempt; it only adds consistency to the reasons forhowpolicies are applied in those circumstances.

These computers are on the domain and locked down with group policy.
We had them all configured with registry keys to auto log in with a specific account.  These accounts do NOT have local admin rights on those PCs.
Once pushing out the DUO agent, these registry keys no longer work.   I still want these computers to have the agent, so if I, as an admin, log in, I get 2-factored.  But I still need the day to day user to log on automatically.  Its not realistic to expect the line operators to remember 10 different computer logins for these shared PC’s.
According to support, this is not possible.  Has anyone found a way to work around this, short of putting a label with the password on each computer monitor?",1
543,https://community.duo.com/t/u-s-government-bulletin-describes-how-cyber-actors-bypassed-two-factor-authentication-implementation/11788,U.S. government bulletin describes how cyber actors bypassed two-factor authentication implementation,General Discussion forum,,Amy,https://community.duo.com/u/Amy,3/17/2022,"On March 15, 2022, aUS government flash bulletinwas published describing how state-sponsored cyber actors were able to exploit certain authentication workflows in combination withPrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527)to gain administrative access to Windows domain controllers. Once administrative access was established, the attacker was able to change two-factor authentication (2FA) configurations and eventually bypass 2FA to gain access to cloud storage services.
This scenario did not leverage or reveal a vulnerability in Duo software or infrastructure but made use of a combination of configurations in 2FA (in this case Duo 2FA) and Windows native authentication workflows. This scenario can be mitigated through a policy configuration in Duo’s Admin Panel (details in the blog here). Duo recommends reviewing your configuration to make sure it meets your current business and security needs.
This information was provided to Duo customers on March 15 via email.

What’s the difference between MSP Level Up and the Level Up beta program?
Duo Level Up (levelup.duo.com) is our general customer learning platform, whereas MSP Level Up (msp.duo.com) is exclusively for MSPs. The courses on both sites are exactly the same, except that MSP specific courses are only available onmsp.duo.com.
How much does the program cost?
As part of our mission to democratize security, all courses on Level Up and MSP Level Up are free and available to those with access to the Duo Admin Panel and at least a Duo Free subscription. We want all of our administrators to be as successful as possible with their Duo deployments and have no plans to charge for this service, even when it is generally available to all customers.
Is certification required?
No, certification is free and available to all interested, but is not a requirement.
I participated in the Level Up Beta Program already, does my course progress transfer?
Yes! As a current Beta customer of Duo Level Up, when you register for the Duo MSP Level Up domain, all of your completed courses and certifications will transfer.  We encourage you to usemsp.duo.comto access your courses going forward.
How do I sign up for MSP Level Up atmsp.duo.com?
To access Duo MSP Level Up, complete the following steps:
Navigate tomsp.duo.com(you will use this domain moving forward)
SelectSign Upand enter access codeeasy2manage
Sign up using the same email address you use to access the Duo Admin Panel athttps://admin.duosecurity.com
How can I get my help desk or other administrators access to MSP Level Up?
We absolutely encourage you to invite your help desk personnel and other support staff to join, as long as they are approved contacts on your account. All participants may use the same access code of easy2manage.
I got an email about this, but when I tried to sign up it said my Access Code was invalid.
That was an error on our part; in the original announcement, the hyperlink text for “msp.duo.com” directed users to the wrong destination. A corrected email was sent out several hours after the initial announcement. I apologize for for the mistake and the inconvenience that caused! If you navigate tomsp.duo.com, click the Sign Up tab, and use theeasy2manageaccess code, you should be able to register successfully.
I want to share feedback and ideas for future MSP Level Up content. How can I do that?
We love feedback! Please feel free to discuss MSP Level Up here on the Managed Service Provider forum, and share your comments with us in the “Share Feedback” modules included near the end of each course. If you’d like to meet with our team and discuss further, feel free to DM me here on the Community, or contact Level Up support atlevelup@duo.com.

Fixed a bug that caused the policy editor UI in the Admin Panel to incorrectly show an entry for aRemembered Devices policyon all custom policies, with a configuration of “Do not remember devices,” where none existed before. Failing to remove the setting of “Do not remember devices” when saving other policy changes could have overridden any existing Remembered Devices settings.Fixed a bug where users inLocked Out statuscould not be edited in the Admin Panel without changing their status first.

There is a guide in theDuo knowledge basethat explainshow to troubleshoot the possible reasons whythis can happen, and we will also be sharing some of those reasons here today. This is a question that commonly comes up in support cases and here in the Community.
You can usually determine the source of the problem by looking at theWindows Event Viewer logs. For details on how to do this, please consult the guide linked previously. Some of the more commonly seen errors when this issue occurs are as follows:
“Access is denied”This error can occur if you did not install the Authentication Proxy as an administrator. You will need to uninstall, then choose “Run as administrator” when you reinstall the Authentication Proxy.You might also see this error if a custom service account you’re using to run the Authentication Proxy service doesn’t have the proper privileges to write to the Event Viewer or the ‘log’ folder used by the Authentication Proxy. You can follow the steps in thearticle on how to address the permission requirements for the service account.“The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion”This may be caused by underlying issues with the OS. To resolve this in Windows, navigate to the Service properties and General tab and set the “Startup type” to “Automatic (Delayed Start)”. More information can be found in theMicrosoft documentation on delayed start.

I have the Duo authentication proxy running on a server internally and I have things configured as accurately as I can figure. The issue is that when I connect to the VPN, I do get the Duo push prompt in the mobile app, but when I approve it nothing happens. The VPN connection times out and I am unable to connect. I have contacted Meraki to have them increase the client VPN timeout value to 60 seconds, but this did not make any difference.

If you’re new to Duo, there are some considerations to keep in mind when making this decision:
What is themost widely used? - By targeting an application the majority of your org uses, you will be able to enroll and familiarize most users with the 2FA experience early on.What ishighly sensitive? - You may want to prioritize the security of your systems and applications that either contain or have direct access to sensitive data.What is theend-user experienceand how willing are your users to adopt 2FA? - When you select applications that present the Duo Prompt for enrollment and self-service, or you first enroll user groups that will be quick to adopt 2FA, you can help to ensure a smoother deployment by reducing resistance.

I have a new requirement to get our netscaler using 2fa with Duo as that second factor.The following guides have been followed & checked by another person & can see nothing wrong, configured as per the guides.
Duo for Citrix Gateway: nFactor Instructions
Duo integrates with Citrix Gateway to add two-factor authentication to VPN logins.
Duo for Citrix Gateway Basic Secondary Authentication Instructions
Duo integrates with Citrix Gateway to add two-factor authentication to VPN logins. For Citrix Receiver or Workspace connections, Duo Security supports passcodes, phone, and push authentication.
We are using version 13 of netscaler gateway & the latest duo proxy. No configuration errors are seen when configuring the proxy.I configure the netscaler virtual server & can see the 3 boxes, dont really want the password2 box, as that should just be for duo. Also I have another virtual server that needs the password2 field, so cant globally hide the box.Whichever way that I configure this, either with the authentication profile, or secondary radius method I get the same. The first screen takes the details (entering push in password2) then I get another page with just password, then no matter what I put in there it just takes me back to the main login screen.Does the Storefront server need any reconfiguring? The gateway for this URL is currently set to just domain, not domain & security token. There is no mention in either of the sites above, so guess it doesnt.Is this something that ideally should be taken to the Duo support team. This is the first time having any issues with duo.

I re-activated DUO on my new phone, but when I sign in to the DUO admin portal and select to send a DUO Push to get logged in, the push arrives at my old phone, not the new one.  So far it is only at this DUO Admin login page that this occurs.  All other push notifications have been working successfully with my new phone.  Any idea why this might be occurring and how to fix it?",1

I was wondering if anyone has been able to get DUO protecting both Microsoft RDG and RRAS on the same Windows Server install?
In order to install Microsoft RDG you need to install NPS on the server, with NPS installed the RADIUS authentication option for RRAS disappears. It appears only one or the other is allowed.
I have been able to setup 2 servers one with the DUO Auth Proxy for VPN and RRAS and a second with the RDG proxy and everything works assuming i have two SSL certs and two public IPs to carry traffice over 443 to my respective internal servers.
Any guidance, or simply a discussion may set off a light bulb.

We have a Win2016 Hyper-V host that is not domain-attached running a Win2016 AD server VM called AD01 and a Win2016 RD server VM called ACT01. The ACT01 VM has all the RD roles – RD Gateway, RD Session Host, RD Web, RD Connection Broker, and RD Licensing, and is running a single LOB application – Act. Users in the same location as the server are running local copies of Act on their PCs to talk to the database on ACT01, and we have three branches that are on site-to-site VPN with 2-3 users each running Act via RemoteApp from the same server – not coming through the gateway, just doing straight RemoteApp sessions from their computers over the VPN. We also have about 4 users occasionally using the Remote Desktop Gateway for work-from-home – they are logging in through the gateway to either remote to their office PCs from home, or in one case, just run a RemoteApp session of Act. I also use the RD Gateway to administer ACT01 and the other VMs via RDP for full desktop sessions. I use a CAP/RAP policy to lock down the users that can use the RD Gateway and the machines they can talk to, and I make sure they have good passwords, etc., but it’s long past time to get everything all 2FAed up.
Also running on the Hyper-V server is a completely different virtualized network on a private virtual switch – I completely virtualized their 18-year-old accounting setup. It’s a separate AD domain with its own Win2008R2 AD server, a Win2003R2 server running MSSQL 2000 and Great Plains 8.0 ERP/Accounting, and 6 Win7 Great Plains clients. The users RDP into the Win7 clients from their desktop PCs and run Great Plains from there. I know, I know, but I did what I had to do to keep things running – this was all physical machines when I started with these folks. At least now it’s behind a pfSense firewall that doesn’t let anything in or out except the RDP sessions from the local office PCs to the GP client VMs. And now we are finally in the process of moving to a cloud-based ERP/accounting solution, and the people implementing that want access to the production accounting system. I was hoping to use ACT01 as a jump host – they RDP through the RD Gateway to ACT01, and from there RDP to a Win7 GP client VM that I’ve set up for them on the private virtual network.
What I want to do is 2FA the RD Gateway – so anyone using the gateway from the internet has to use 2FA. I don’t want to make the branch users using the RemoteApp version of Act from ACT01 to have to 2FA – they’re already on machines in the physical stores that are on the VPN, and presumably OK – if not I have bigger problems. But I want anyone coming into the RD Gateway from the internet have to 2FA to get an RD session, either to RemoteApp to ACT01 to run Act, to get a desktop session to use it as a jump host, or to connect to their desktop PCs.
I tried installing Duo for RD Gateway, and it worked pretty much the way I was hoping to talk to any of the other machines behind the gateway - I started the connection, got a push, OKed it, and was able to login to the AD01 server and a couple of other machines. But RDP sessions to the ACT01 server itself started and just died after the push notification was approved. It worked for other machines – I got the push, approved, and logged in. But attempts to login to the RD session host with a desktop session or a RemoteApp session even from within the network, not through the gateway, would send a push, I would approve, and then the session would just close. I thought maybe I needed to install Duo for RD Web as well, and I tried that, but the install just hung before I got to the part where it asks for the keys. I was running out of time in my maintenance window, so I rolled the machine back to a pre-Duo RDG install checkpoint and we’re back at square one.
Any thoughts about the inability to login to the machine Duo was running on? Any thoughts in general? Send brickbats and attaboys my way please…",1

I have a implementation of VPN (RADIUS auth) utilizing DUO proxy. Works fine except when, for example, client is having wifi connectivity issues (low signal, automatic change of wifi network, etc), therefore VPN does reconnect. At that point, since it has no sense of having DUO due to the radius protocol, DUO push notifications can be annoying and/or counterproductive and I fully understand why it behaves like this (technically).
Now, since this is happening, in some cases more that others, I would like to know did anyone had similar issues and how did they resolved it or is there any half-elegant way of resolving it?

Improvements to the management of inactiveDuo administrators
Duo administrators whose accounts haveexpired due to inactivitywill now show a status of Expired in the Administrators list in theDuo Admin Panel. When viewing the administrator details page, you will now see the number of days of inactivity and be able to clear their Expired status. Clearing their Expired status is reported in theAdministrator Actions Log.In addition, administrators with the status of Expired will be unable to access the Admin Panel.Admins with the status of Expired cannot have their role changed to Owner until their inactivity is cleared, and Owner-role admins cannot be set to a status of Expired in order to enforce at least one active Owner per account. Duo recommends creating at least two administrative users with the Owner role per account.

On end-users Macbooks, there is no listing in the prompt.  It simply says enter code or type in option, but it doesn’t specifically list the options.  This is not a problem per se, as if they type push, then it works as expected.  If they enter code listed in Duo App, it does not work.

So it’s kind of a confusing workflow, to not actually login to the DAG which is empty, but instead click to manage devices during the login process.  We made an attempt at creating our own Device Management Portal using the guides, but we aren’t developers so it didn’t work out.

I’ve been running Duo on OpenVPN Access Server since September of 2021 without any issues.  I’m running version 2.10.1 of OPVN AS and version 2.5 of the Duo script.
I installed Duo back in September and everything worked fine.  I received Duo prompts for the web interface when logging into the VPN server and when logging into the admin panel for the AS.  Just this weekend I tried getting into the AS admin panel.  I received the Duo prompt on my phone, approved it and then I get an error on the web page that says “ERR_Too_Many_Redirects”.  I tried in a different browser and received a similar message about the page not redirecting properly.  It mentions that this could be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies.  If I delete the trailing text from the AS url I am able to get to the AS admin panel.
I also just updated the AS to the latest version.  I don’t recall having this issue on the previous version of the AS, but my memory is a little foggy whether I tried logging into the AS admin panel when I updated the AS last month.
I haven’t tried uninstalling the script, but will give that a try and then reinstall the script later today if I get time and report back.
Other thing to note is that this only happens when trying to access the admin panel.  Everything works as expected if I am just accessing the web server or using the VPN client.  So I’m not sure if something changed with the AS and how it interacts with Duo.
Any other suggestions/feedback is welcome.

I am working on a few Perl scripts using the Duo::API module from GitHub.

This seems to be from the call tocroak($msg)in theparse_json_response()function.

End of support for U2F security keys used with Duo’s browser-based prompt
Google has announced it willno longer supportU2F in Chrome beginning later this year. To accommodate this change, Duo has also ended support for the U2F authentication standard for security keys used with our browser-based authentication prompt as of January 24, 2022. WebAuthn is now the sole supported standard for security keys used with Duo’s browser-based prompt.Duo customers do not need to take any action in response to this end-of-support milestone, and existing security keys will continue to work normally. For more information about the end of support milestone, see thisDuo Knowledge Base article.Note: U2F security keys will continue to be supported forWindows Offline Access, which does not use the browser-based authentication prompt. In addition, customers using Chrome OS in conjunction with U2F security keys have been granted an extension of April 30, 2022 to move to theDuo Universal Prompt. In certain use cases, Chrome OS logins do not support the pop-up needed to complete a WebAuthn security key authentication using the traditional Duo Prompt.

While effective, it is important to consider that shifting to remote work requires more flexible device policies to allow access to corporate apps and data from BYOD/unmanaged devices. Securing these resources means companies need greater visibility into user behavior and device posture, and the ability to enforce granular, application-specific policies to reduce the risk of data compromise. Adopting a zero-trust security strategy for remote access to internal resources can address this need, and Duo Security is ready to help.

I setup RDP first, created a custom policy for SMS Passcode-only authentication, assigned into to a group and added the one user who needed to authenticate via SMS to that group. It worked perfectly.
I then setup RRAS and used the same custom policy for this new application, adding my second SMS-only user (he doesn’t need access to the Remote Desktop Server, just VPN access).
Both users failed to authenticate their VPN connection.They just receive the standard “The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server” message.
If I change the authentication method from SMS Passcode to Phone Callback a call is received and the VPN connects successfully.

Reading it led me to the following question:For what I read here, it is unclear if there is still an expiration on the remembered devices feature.
Indeed, the only part mentioning an expiration is:
A user who has previously selected to “Trust browser” andwhose “Trust browser” cookie has expiredwill see a filled-in “Trust browser” checkbox on the first screen in the Universal Prompt 2FA flow.
Does this mean that, even with an expired cookie, the “Trust browser” checkbox will stay enabled?

The duo-protected items pick up their icon from the Duo service, and there are pre-made icons for several of the other TOTP items I use (like AWS), but for the majority of logins I have to either pick an incorrect icon from the app’s list of icons, or just go without.
Having icons to visually differentiate the logins when scanning through the list is a huge help, so I end up going with distinct (but often incorrect) icons so that each service has a visual identifier. However, it would beeven betterif the app supported user-specified icons—either by picking an image from my device’s filesystem, or by feeding the app the URL of an image I want to use.

We are utilizing Directory Sync, and a group to control who is eligible for Duo at any point in time, so we have the “should be using Duo” and “not required to use Duo” part of the problem figured out.   Fully enrolled users are (as we are seeking), prompted for Duo as expected, and denied access if they are unable to complete the authentication.
Where we are getting stuck is for users that have opted-in (or been opted-in because of their role), but have not yet enrolled.    Our preference would be to nag them to enroll, but allow them to continue without MFA for at least some period of time.
The self-enrollment does not appear to offer any “skip for now” option, so we were pursuing a New User policy involving “Allow unenrolled users to pass through without two-factor authentication.”
However, if we pair that with Authentication policy of “Require two-factor authentication or enrollment when applicable…” synced by unenrolled users forced to enroll, and if we use the “Skip two-factor authentication or enrollment when applicable…” policy, no users are prompted by Duo.
So, is there a way to accomplish our goal:
All fully enrolled users are prompted for Duo authentication.Partially enrolled users are allowed through without Duo auth, in some form.
All fully enrolled users are prompted for Duo authentication.
Partially enrolled users are allowed through without Duo auth, in some form.

The organization controls user access on a per-application basis and applies granular control policies. This ensures healthy devices, on acceptable networks, are allowed access after the appropriate checks are completed while the riskier devices are denied access accordingly.
Duo is pleased to announce that Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) support for Duo Network Gateway is in Public Preview!RDP is one of the most widely used remote access protocols, but it is also one of the most vulnerable. With this launch, our customers can embrace secure VPN-less access to remote desktops while using the native RDP applications and workflows they are already familiar with.
The user’s experience will change slightly:
Start to access an RDP server with any RDP clientPrimary authentication with your identity provider (IdP)Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with Duo PromptSecure connection established through DNG to RDP server
Start to access an RDP server with any RDP client
Primary authentication with your identity provider (IdP)
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with Duo Prompt
Secure connection established through DNG to RDP server

RDP for Duo Network Gateway is currently in Public Preview, meaning that you can set things up, try it out, and even break things as you see fit! The only ask from Duo is that if a rough edge is discovered or something within the documentation feels like it could be more complete, let us know. This is your opportunity to push the DNG forward, in the direction that keeps you and your organization in mind!

But to the point: I configured PANW GP portal and Duo SSO with Authentication Proxy running one of our AD server.Everything (almost) exactly as it is written in manual (Duo Single Sign-On for Palo Alto GlobalProtect | Duo Security). “Almost” because on very beginning I do not useCertificate for Signing Requestin GP Portal’s Authentication Profile (honestly speaking I am not sure what are requirements for this cert) however I do not think it is necessary (right now).My test users is properly authenticated with Duo push/SMS/whatever.I see it in Authentication Proxy logs:
{“timestamp”: “2022-01-01T14:05:57.934594Z”, “msg”: “Successful authentication against server”, “event_type”: “ldap_query”, “query_type”: “Primary authentication”, “status”: “succeeded”, “server”:…
and PANW system logs:
and PANW system logs:
image1285×137 62.9 KB
The issue is, that just after authentication my GP agent showsYou are not authorized to connect to GlobalProtect Portal

Uncle Google has found in PANW resources that such message is mostly caused if user does not belong to proper AD group… But he belongs, he was authenticated
I started to dig and I have found these:
in PANW GP log entries with error:

Failed to get client configuration

image1365×146 50.6 KB
So, IMHO even if user authenticates correctly, for some reasonsa domain(I hope it is about AD domain)is not known(how could it be if full DN is visible in Authentication Proxy logs?)and it makes impossible to match username with AD group bound to configuration created for GP agent(at GP portal).
User belongs to this group for sure because on same device I have another GP portal which uses exactly same configuration (GP agent, group, user) however without Duo authentication (AD only) and it works correctly…
So, I started to think that maybe it is something about attributes provided by Duo to PANW. Maybe it should bedomain/10000007and not bare10000007?A few minutes ago I made simple test: using exactly same username I logged in to AD authenticated GP portal then tried to do same to Duo authenticated one.And you know what? It seems I was right:
image1365×156 30.4 KB
(GP_MFA is Duo authenticated GP Portal name)
Guys, does anybody know how to force Duo to provide this additional domain\ string?
I guessed it is about configuration of attributes passed by Duo to PANW directly. So, I thought I have to change configuration of Duo SSO especially sectionDuo username attributesbut IMHO it is wrong approach regarding toDuo Single Sign-On | Duo Security:
Duo username attribute  (Optional)The email address that users type in during SSO login will be matched to the user in Duo. If your Duo usernames do not match the email address value(s) for your specified Email attributes, you enable the Specify Duo username attribute option and type in the name of an Active Directory attribute that does contain the values that match your Duo usernames.
Example: Your users have email addresses in AD with the formatnorben.arroway@example.com, but your Duo usernames are thesAMAccountNamevalues with the formatnarroway. AddsAMAccountNameas a Duo username attribute.
Default: No alternate username attribute; send email address as Duo username.
…and I ran out of ideas… Maybe there is a way to add some parameters in Authentication Proxy configuration to adddomain\?
Guys, talking that “I am a bit frustrated” about this case is… hmmmmm… let’s say: not enough…
Anybody can help me?thx in adv…",0

Out of about 100 clients, five of them have run into issue with the VPN connection process.  When the process works, the user opens GlobalProtect, clicks ‘Connect’, approves the Duo Push notification, and sees a succesful VPN connection.  When the process fails, it is failing somewhere between the user clicking ‘Connect’ and Duo sending out the push notificiation.  Each user has had a slightly different experience when it fails.  Here’s what we have observed:
a blank GlobalProtect browser window opens (where we would normally see the Duo Universal Prompt)
a blank GlobalProtect browser window opens AND the user receives a Java script error.
GlobalProtect’s browser window opens and states it cannot connect securely to this page (due to outdated or unsafe TLS security settings).

I first want to say that if this post is wrongly categorized, please let me know so I can post it in the correct category.
We recently purchased Duo and have slowly started to enroll our users. We’re doing this in phases. Our last phase will be to put the nail in the coffin and disallow any logins if the user isnotenrolled. We don’t want to enable that settingyetas it would create absolute chaos. So for right now, it’s not enabled.
We have a Remote Desktop Service (RDS) environment, with a Remote Desktop (RD) web access, RD gateway, RD connection broker, and several RD session hosts. All of these servers run Windows Server 2016 and have the January 2020 cumulative update.
We have Duo working and set up with our RDS environment and has been working quite well for us so far. Since we have Duo working in our environment, we are able to see all authentications against us. We have recently started to see some very strange authentication logs. These authentication logs use the users SID to log in rather than the user names, and they’re at very strange times. The are apparently coming from Microsoft RD Web and have an unknown location with an IP address of 0.0.0.0:
image1063×611 18.5 KB
We are getting lots of these. What’s more scary is that some of these SIDs are users who already have Duo enabled and working. So it’s not even prompting the user to allow or deny the login attempt. Now, this could be ended by simply disallowing any user login that’s unenrolled, but we’re not there yet. However to think that it’s happening regardless, is a tad concerning as well. I noticed that my SID was included in the list. I’ve recently changed my password about a week ago, and it still appeared.
Anyway, I hopped on our RD Web server and dug through the events in the event viewer. I found logs at the same time as the timestamps in the Duo authentication log. The logs were:
(2/21/2020 12:38:39 AM) Event ID 4624 - An account was successfully logged on(2/21/2020 12:38:39 AM) Event ID 4634 - An account was logged off.
These happened at the same time which I thought was odd too.
Has anyone seen SIDs in the Duo authentication log before? Is Duo doing something to our RD servers or vice versa? Is our RD servers interacting idle sessions on our session host? Should we be concerned with anything?",0

However, reinstalling the app does not help to unlock the Windows reserved ports and hence the user ends up in an endless troubleshooting loop when the Duo Health app is running, but still, the 2fa page asks the user to install it.
Recommended change:
after launching the Duo Device Health app, if the app has failed to allocate a tcp socket, notify the user with a pop-up message that they should contact their IT Support team for a Socket allocation has failed.
after launching the Duo Device Health app, if the app has failed to allocate a tcp socket, notify the user with a pop-up message that they should contact their IT Support team for a Socket allocation has failed.
Tech details:
At least on my computer, Windows has reserved the port numbers 531xx for its internal use (WinNAT service) and when any app tries to allocate those ports, they fail, as for example, starting a Python HTTP server on port 53101:
The workaround was to turn off the WinNAT service:
and then the Duo Device Health also started to work normally (well, had to kill the existing process that failed to allocate the port and start it again).",0

We have Office 365 (Azure + On Prem hybrid) protected using Conditional Access policies to use Duo. Our new users are issued with a Yubikey 5 NFC or Yubikey 5C (if on Mac), which is great except it doesn’t seem to be a recognized device by Office applications (Outlook, Teams, any of the Office suite).
When setting up the devices, we have to use Bypass Codes to initially setup Office, or if the password is changed post-initial setup before the users have registered another device like a phone.
This is somewhat embarrassing and I also don’t understand why the apps don’t work. I’ve tested the Yubikey through Edge using Yubikeys U2F and OTP tests, and the key is acknowledged and seems to work just fine. It’s the apps themselves that don’t seem to like it.

I am looking to implement a PUSH notification with a DUO mobile feature for my customer. I found the below link using which support is possible. But I am facing some issues with this.
Duo Auth API
The Duo Auth API is a low-level, RESTful API for adding strong two-factor authentication to your website or application. Learn more.
I used /enroll endpoint for generating activation_code & activation_barcode for any user. After calling this endpoint it will either create new codes or give theuser already existerror.
As the same user exists on Jira, Confluence & Bitbucket with the same username. So if I call /enroll endpoint from a different location then it will create a new user only once & for the rest calls, it gives the user already exist error. I can solve this issue by making some changes to the username. But it will create a new user on DUO with a different username. So this solution is acceptable.
Is there any way to solve this? Do you have any API/endpoint using which I can get activation_code & activation_barcode for a user if it already exists? So that I can show these codes to the user whenever he is looking for registration.
I hope you will help me out. Looking forward to hearing from you.",0
685,https://community.duo.com/t/only-getting-about-two-seconds-to-approve-duo-push-before-vpn-fails-connection/11177,Only getting about two seconds to approve Duo push before VPN fails connection,VPN,,JoshuaB,https://community.duo.com/u/JoshuaB,12/17/2021,"So the rundown of what is happening is we use Duo to secure our VPN access. The device is Meraki MX 450 with support for Cisco Anyconnect. Authentication is provided to the Meraki with Radius/AD with a Duo Auth Proxy server.
When you open Anyconnect and connect it talks to the VPN and prompts for username and password. When you enter the correct info you receive a Duo Push on your device. About two seconds later (literally two seconds maybe three) if you have not hit approve on the app or don’t have the app open staring at it to pop up. The VPN then prompts for username and password again.
If you hit approve fast enough the VPN will show you are connected. Else hitting approve after will still show the success on the Duo Mobile but you won’t be connected to the VPN.
Some things I tried were to make sure the Meraki, AnyConnect, and phones are all up to date. Also, I set the profile on Anyconnect to have timeouts of 30 seconds.
From what I can gather is that the Meraki and VPN are not aware of Duo, it’s just an extra layer on the authentication side with Radius on the Duo Auth Proxy. It just seems like there is a missing timer on when the push is sent and the time to respond. I hope there is a setting on the Auth Proxy server but I don’t know.
We also use Duo for RDP on the inside network and we are having no trouble.",0

Ourmost popular posts of the yearincluded a few technical questions answered by various members of the Community:
Why might I see an error “The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server” when logging in to Microsoft RRAS VPN with Duo?This error can occur when a user attempts to establish a remote connection to the VPN. This issue is related to the default sign-in information configured in the RRAS client connection profile. See the community post for more information on how to fix this.Why are my users being prompted continuously for credentials when logging in to a federated domain for Microsoft 365 with Duo Single Sign-On?This issue is typically due to basic authentication still being allowed in the O365 tenant. In addition to enabling modern authentication, which is required for MFA, you will also want to disable basic authentication. Instructions can be found in the community post.Is it possible to authenticate to multiple Active Directory (AD) domains using Duo?Neither Duo Access Gateway or Duo Single Sign-On support multiple authentication sources nor AD authentication using a single source across AD cross-forest trusts today. Use of the GC port is an answer for authentication against any child domains in a single forest.

Fun Fact
On this day in 1903 Orville and Wilbur Wright performed the first sustained motorized flight by a manned heavier-than-air aircraft in theWright Flyer. They flew it four times on December 17th outside of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, each time flying it straight without any turns and each with an unintended, bumpy landing. After the last flight, a wind gust blew the plane over and damaged it beyond repair or ability to fly. Today the plane (since repaired for display) is exhibited in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

The majority of my users have Outlook installed and we see the Office 365 prompt to login.  When we do cutover to Duo for authentication will we start to see a Duo prompt rather than a 365 prompt?",1

I’m setting up Duo MFA for a small business. I understand having a minimum purchase of 10 users, this makes sense to me in terms of overhead for managing accounts. but having to buy in 10 user increments seems punitive for small businesses. It means 11 users costs the same as 20 and that seems unfair. I really do think you should allow purchases in units of 1 user above 10. The 10 user increment feels extractive and customer hostile once you’ve got us onboard, and especially since the headline is $3 a user, not $30 for 10 users and 10 user increments after. I didn’t see the 10 user incremental purchase requirement until well after I had started the trial, it’s on one page on the main site under a long comparison table, while $3/user is everywhere - it feels very bait and switch-y, not a good look.",0

We currently have it setup so that users need to confirm the Duo MFA when connecting to our cisco AnyConnect VPN. But just in this past hour, Duo was down and it caused users not to be able to connect.
We also have a policy for Admins when they RDP or sign into a computer, that they need to confirm the MFA as well. This was bypassed when Duo was down and didn’t prompt us.
It was nice that I could get into my PC but why would it By-pass for one policy and not the other when the service was down. We would want our users to be able to VPN still and be able to work when the service is down, if we have to rely on Duo being up 24/7 for us to be able to work, that sounds bad.
Also, we got no alert about the service going down and theStatus.Duo.compage didn’t have anything about this issue on it.",1

“Invalid secondary username or password. Please re-enter user information”
This isn’t specifically a DUO error and is more to do with the machine as the user can log on fine on other machines with the same credentials. I understand that rebuilding the machine from scratch will most likely fix the issue but before I go through that process of getting it shipped to me and rebuilding.

We had been using the Domain Admin as the ‘service_account_username’ in the [ad_client] section.  Of course, we want to get away from that.
Since gMSA accounts aren’t supported in the ad_client section, I created a regular domain user (DuoAuthUser) for that login.  But when I put DuoAuthUser there with its password (and encrypt the file of course), our employees’ VPN logins are rejected.  If I make the DuoAuthUser a member of Domain Admins, employees can login to the VPN.
The AuthProxy reference says thatservice_account_usernameshould be “The username of an account that has permission to read from your Active Directory database. We recommend creating a service account that has read-only access.”
Shouldn’t a regular domain user have enough read permissions over AD to work here?  Or are additional permissions needed?",1

Sometimes users may run into issues where they can no longer receive Duo Push notifications and reactivation is required. Since Duo Mobile is tied to the device’s Hardware Security Module, any changes to a phone’s hardware can affect activation status.
There are a number of reasons that this can occur, and you can check out thefull list in the help article on this topic. Some of the most common, though, are as follows:
An end-user with an Android device deletes or uninstalls (and reinstalls) the Duo Mobile app.A user deletes the account from their account list in the Duo Mobile app.A user loses their phone and attempts to set up a new device.
An end-user with an Android device deletes or uninstalls (and reinstalls) the Duo Mobile app.

Fun Fact
On this day in 1901, the first Nobel prize for physics was awarded toWilhelm Conrad Röntgenfor discovering x-rays. His continued experiments producedthe first radiograph, an image of his wife’s hand wearing a ring. The discovery happened in November 1895, but soon after doctors were using the new photographic technique to diagnose broken bones and other ailments without any invasive surgeries. Röntgen did not patent his findings, stating his “inventions and discoveries belong to the world at large,"" which allowed further research worldwide. He also donated his Nobel prize money (50,000 Swedish krona) to the University of Würzburg.

We have scripts so that when a user is added to Active Directory, they will get automatically synced to Duo as a bypass user. After 2 weeks, they are converted to a regular user.

GA timeline announced forDuo Universal Prompt
The Duo Universal Prompt, our redesign of Duo’s core authentication experience for web-based applications, is scheduled to become generally available in late January / early February 2022.Administrators can decide when to enable the new prompt for existing applications. The Universal Prompt will be the default experience for newly created applications. You can choose to use the traditional Duo Prompt if you prefer. Note: Not all Duo-protected applications support the Universal Prompt. Refer toour documentationfor more information.At GA, the Universal Prompt will provide feature parity for Duo’s MFA and Access editions; Beyond edition endpoint features and policies are stillunder development. The Universal Prompt will fall back to the current Duo Prompt UI to complete workflows required for Duo Beyond edition features that have not yet been built into the new prompt.Thetraditional prompt experienceandWeb SDK v2applications remain supported through the Universal Prompt preview period and after GA. Duo will communicate well in advance of the end-of-support date, allowing at least 18 months for migration to supported solutions.

New and updated applications
Trusted Endpoints for Microsoft Intune with Device Healthnow generally available
Intune with Device Health uses theDuo Device Health applicationto verify device trust on Intune-managed Windows endpoints without reliance on device certificates. When users authenticate to applications protected with Duo’s browser-based prompt, Duo matches the device information reported by the Device Health app with managed device information obtained from Intune via API.Note: The Device Health app is not currently able to collect device identifiers from Autopilot devices. Do not use Windows Autopilot to enroll or refresh the devices on which you want to check for device trust with the Device Health app. Intune devices that are set up with Windows Autopilot will be supported in a future version of the Device Health app.For instructions on migrating from Trusted Endpoints certificates to Trusted Endpoints with the Device Health app, refer to thisDuo Knowledge Base article.With the release of Device Health support for Intune, you can no longer create new certificate-based Intune integrations. Duo continues to support existing Intune Windows certificate deployments and will do so until the integration reaches end-of-life status, planned for the second half of 2022.In addition, the instructions for configuring Intune integrations have been updated to specify a narrower scope of API permissions for Azure Active Directory than previously required. Previously created integrations do not need to be adjusted.

We’re using Duo SSO for our VPN authentication, and I was wondering if there is a way to use SSO for either Outlook Web Access or RDP connections as well?   Looking at the list of supported applications in our portal, I didn’t see SSO as an option for either, but, was curious if anyone had managed to make that work with those services.

We’re implementing 2fa authentication with DUO for an application of ours we’re building. This works perfectly when we run the software locally (redict url via ngrok) or on a Windows server, but not on our production server: the health check (.DoHealthCheck()) always fails.
We use the C# client from github:GitHub - duosecurity/duo_universal_csharp: Duo two-factor authentication for .NET web applications
To extract the problem from our application itself we created a small console app app which does nothing else than create a Duo Universal client with our settings, and run the health check and outputs if it succeeded or not. This also only works on the Windows machines (outputs ‘True’) and not the Linux machines (outputs ‘False’).
I suspect it has something to do differences between the SSL version and/or protocol in both the linux and windows machines.
I changed the DoHealthCheck a bit to output the error, and that says:System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate was rejected by the provided RemoteCertificateValidationCallback
Anyone any ideas how to fix this?",0

The second time is most often then not successful, although I have at times had the login timeout twice in a row.
I know there are a few things Windows wise we could do, such as setting the login timeout timer to a larger value in the registry keys. We have also tried ensuring that the system is up to date on drivers, BIOS, Windows updates, etc. just to be safe. Lastly we disabled all High demand start up services that are not required to see if the problem might lie in Windows itself taking too long to start, and therefore the DUO notification coming in too late.
However, the Windows login timeout timer is managed by security groups on our AD server, and I seem to be the only one amongst my immediate peers that has this issue. I was hoping to ask the community if there is anyone who has experienced such an issue and if it is for some odd reason related to DUO and not my startup time that makes the push notification come late.
I can’t test my start up time now that DUO is implemented company wide but I don’t recall it taking long to login at all prior to the implementation. I will be continuing to investigate why it might be Windows of course, as to tackle the issue both ways. But any feedback or experiences would be appreciated!

Duo Proxy sends it to Cisco ISE
ISE does authentication against AD, LDAP or local user database (depending on certain attributes)
ISE sends ACCESS-ACCEPT back to DUO proxy
DUO proxy sends it back to ASA.

Later, when ISE issues CoA, it sends it to DUO Proxy and it seems like DUO proxy doesn’t know what to do with it and just drops it. It never forwards it to ASA. I did a packet capture on DUO Proxy and I see that it actually receives it.
I guess one possible way would be for ASA to send request to ISE and ISE send to DUO Proxy… Unfortunately, in my case, ISE has to do primary authentication, and I don’t think I can use [duo_client_only] in this scenario.

Owners are prevented from being part of administrative units. Attempting to assign the role of Owner to an admin who is part of an administrative unit will now return an error. To complete the role change, first remove the administrator from all administrative units and then setrestricted_by_admin_unitstofalse.Fixed a bug in which SMS requested when logging in via the Duo Universal Prompt contained more than one passcode if the Admin Panel was configured to send a batch of passcodes (a feature supported in the traditional Duo Prompt).

Fun Fact
On this day in 1959,Rocky & His Friends(aka The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show, among other variations) debuted on ABC. “Jet Fuel Formula” begins the pilot episode and is the longest story arc of the Rocky & Bullwinkle show. The segments in this episode established many of the characters, running jokes, and themes that later episodes would reference. You can watch several segments from the first episodehere. Fun fact: For a time, a puppet version of Bullwinkle opened the show, and… “On one occasion, “Bullwinkle” encouraged children to pull the tuning knobs off their television sets. (“It’s loads of fun, and that way, you’ll be sure to be with us next week!”) The network received complaints from parents of an estimated 20,000 child viewers who actually did so. Bullwinkle told the children the following week to put the knobs back on with glue “and make it stick!” The puppet sequence was dropped altogether.”

I’m asking because I would like to roll this out a few users at a time rather than an entire tenant.
Reading the365 Documentationit makes me think the switch happens when the domain becomes federated.
Once you federate a custom domain your Microsoft Online tenant with Duo Access Gateway, all Microsoft 365 applications will redirect those federated users to Duo Access Gateway when they sign in, while cloud-only (non-federated) users continue to log in using the Microsoft online sign-in form.

So in testing Duo for my test tenant, I imported accounts via Azure Directory Sync. That went great.
I created a Duo protected application for my M365 cloud apps. Worked great.
So I noticed that I now have duplicate names. I see in some other posts that “username normalization” will cause this but I am not really sure which accounts I should delete.
The account that was spontaneously created works and the dir sync account shows as never authenticated. The “never authenticated” has all the relevant account info like email, first\last name etc.
So I need to enforce users using their sync’d account and not have Duo create a new account.
Do I simply turn off username normalization, delete the newly created account and have the sync’d account perform a new enrollment?
I wish there was a “merge” feature and an admin could choose which account was to be deleted etc.
Thanks!

This is a question that comes up often in support cases and can have multiple different causes.
The first reason this might occur is if the DAG does not identify the correct IP address for the user attempting to access the DAG admin console access (for example, resolving the internal IP instead of the external IP). This might happen if you deploy DAG as a virtual machine in externally hosted infrastructure (such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure), because the VM is typically assigned both an internal and external IP address. This can also occur if DNS is not configured appropriately for the type of access being attempted.
Some other causes to this issue are:
If you have specified an incorrect server hostname during DAG installation.If IIS does not have the Default Web Site settings configured correctly for the Launcher or the DAG admin console.

I am a little unclear on how to set up inline/self-enrollment for use with Windows logon (Microsoft RDP app).
Basically, I would like to have the Duo agent installed on user workstations and then have new Duo users log in and then get prompted to set up the Duo app ON THAT PC and then use the push notification.
The problem I am running into is:
If I add the user in Duo (user name and email), when the user logs in, it just said the user is not activated in Duo.
If I add a phone to that user, when the user logs onto the Windows PC, they only have the option to get sent a text code. There are no instructions to install the Duo app and enable push.
It seems like the only way I can get it like I want is if I first enroll the users and they get emailed the link to set up the Duo app. The problem with that, is once Duo is installed on ALL computers, then new employees/Duo users won’t be able to log into Windows to check their email to setup Duo to log into Windows.
How can I actually set it up so that the non-Duo enrolled user can log into Windows with their AD account and then instructions on the screen to install the Duo app, scan the QR code and then use the push notification to get in??",0

But for some reason the same thing is not happening in another application. There sig_response is absent from the form collection.
I am implementing the MFA Request (the iframe) as a separate ASPX page and the response page (VerifyResponse()) as a separate ASPX page to keep things separate and neat. I am using the same set of settings IKey, AKey, SKey, etc for both apps. I have also tried using a different set of IKey and Skey for the other application to no effect.

I’m attempting to build an authentication integration through the API. Most everything is working as expected, except for the auth_status endpoint when working through an ‘asynchronous’ request (only tested using the ‘push’ factor)
The initial request returns the ‘txid’ attribute as documented.
However, when I then try to check on the status of that authentication after a few seconds using the auth_status endpoint, sending ‘txid’ as a parameter, the API call results are not returned until the authentication request has completed (‘allow’ or ‘deny’), or the https connection times out, similar to a ‘non’-asynchronous request.
This isn’t what I had anticipated, thinking instead the results of the query would be returned ‘immediately’, indicating whether the request has completed, or is still ‘waiting’.  Have I made an incorrect assumption, or perhaps done something wrong?
Thanks,Sean.",0

Policies are essential to managing a Duo deployment, but they can also be really confusing sometimes (even for me, and I wrote the course!).

This may be a silly question but I’m not super familiar with the inner workings of Azure AD when it comes to syncing accounts from my on-prem AD setup.
We have an on-prem AD setup and we also use Azure AD Connect to sync internal users to AAD in order to use Office 365 products.
I’m setting up duo now and I was wondering if I could get away with syncing Duo with AAD instead of my on-prem AD. I would like to avoid installing the proxy is all, but I’m not sure if this would cause any issues down the road? Would I be better off just syncing using the internal proxy?

but as you probably guessed, when a user logs in via the rdp client, they get prompted then when they hit the rds server… they get hit again with duo authentication.
am i being too paranoid?, do i need the windows agent, or… I haven’t tried yet… but if i remove the windows agent and try to login to the console directly with one of the protected accounts that has access to the rds server will they get prompted even though they didn’t arrive at the server via the remote desktop app?

We are trying to setup the AuthProxy in an environment that uses LDAP and SSH with key-based authentication. We got the proxy to work with password authentication, however it does not work with keys.
In case of password authentication, the usual LDAP communication flow looks like this:
LDAP Bind Request with the service account (read only account)
LDAP Search Request, Search Response etc…
LDAP Bind Request with the user trying to authenticate → this is where Duo steps in and prompts for the second factor - we submit it and login works
With key-based auth however, the following happens:
LDAP Bind Request with service account
LDAP Search Request, Search Response contains public key
Rest of the authentication is handled “normally”, no 2nd bind occurs with the authenticating user → no MFA is triggered
Is there any solution or workaround to this problem? Using password authentication is not an option.",0

I’m integrating duo_universal_java with an existing Kerberos / NTLM style SSO for corporate InterAnet environments where clients are joined to a Windows domain.
Kerberos / NTLM SSO does not prompt the user for a password at all (they are authenticated continuously and transparently all the time) and so there is no login page to trigger 2FA.
To trigger 2FA I was thinking that a cookie would be used to detect if the user has not performed 2FA within some expiry period.
However, I obviously need to cryptographically bind the cookie to the application and preferably the user. From googling about such things it seems that some folks use the Client ID and username to generate the key. However, the Client ID could be exposed in logs or perhaps in browser-space. If an interloper knew the Client ID, they could forge the cookie.
So the question is, what should I use as a good key for signed cookies?
I have seen references to an Application ID that looks like it might be used for this purpose but duo_universal_java nor theduosecurity.comdashboard has a reference to this property.
I could just make up a random key but this is an extra installation step that might be unnecessary. I like to make things as easy as possible for users.
Does Duo have guidance on what key to use for signed cookies and maybe a specific method of using the username, timestamp and SHA256 or whatever?",0

Minor change to login flow forDuo Single Sign-Onwith Active Directory
Introduced a minor change to the authentication experience for Duo Single Sign-On that adds a new first screen in the authentication flow featuring only the email address field. From there, a user will either enter their email address (if it did not auto-populate based on a cookie), or just click Next. On the second screen, a user will enter their password, and then click Login to complete primary authentication.This change allows Duo to introduce new features in the future, includingDuo Passwordless, which uses identity verification methods such as biometrics in place of passwords.This change only affects Duo Single Sign-On with Active Directory as the authentication source. Duo Single Sign-On with a SAML authentication source is not affected. Learn more in theDuo Knowledge Base.Additionally, a user’s email address will auto-populate in the email address field for Duo Single Sign-On when logging back in to a new session. This is managed via browser cookie and does not carry across multiple browsers or clients.

We use SailPoint IdentityIQ 8.0p1 as our IDAM and password reset solution, and I’m trying to come up with a way for new users to reset their temporary password, who don’t have a device enrolled in Duo yet. Our IdentityIQ implementation requires Duo MFA for all logins, and all new user accounts are forced to change their password on the next login. Since IdentityIQ doesn’t support inline registration, the reset process just fails. The users have active Duo accounts, which are being created by Duo using the AD sync process to pull all accounts in a certain AD group, and then sends the enrollment email to their company email address. They can’t get to this email without logging in, and they can’t login due to the issue mentioned above.
Since I’m a developer in IdentityIQ, and we have already customized the MFA form in it, I’m trying to see if I can get the enroll_portal_url from Duo on the PreAuth call. Unfortunately, our Test Duo system is only sending back “deny” instead of “enroll” in the PreAuth response when the user has an active account, but no devices are enrolled. My Duo admin tells me its because they don’t have “auto-enroll” turned on in Test.(limited licenses) Is that why I never get the “enroll” response, or is there some other setting that I might need to have changed? I have also tried posting a message to the “enroll” endpoint in Duo, but then I get an error back stating that the account already exists. These are already active Duo accounts, so I’m not sure why the “auto-enroll” setting would matter, I’m just trying to get a new device enrollment URL to present to the user, instead of the one that is sitting in their inbox.
I greatly appreciate any help you can provide.Thanks!Mike Frank",1

825,https://community.duo.com/t/v4-app-half-a-step-forward-2-steps-back/10564,V4 App,"Half a step forward, 2 steps back! | Duo Mobile app forum",,JasonP,https://community.duo.com/u/JasonP,10/17/2021,"Looking at your release notes, I would be described as an advanced user, and I appreciate that most of the changes are not aimed at me. However, there are a couple of features that seem to have been removed from v4 that just make my life a bit more difficult.
I use my phone app to manage 10 different DUO accounts and have about 50 TOTP logins (soon to be about 150). Finding a TOTP code in that lot is a bit of a pain and card-based layout does nothing to assist with this. It is so disappointing that DUO still hasn’t implemented a folder system for the app.
This takes me to one of the backward steps. In the v3 app, as well as renaming the account, you could also change the ‘Account’. We used this to group TOTP to a particular ‘account’ so they have the same icon making them easier to find. For example, we assign all our TOTP for mail servers to ‘ProtonMail’. They aren’t ProtonMail in actuality but it means they all have the same icon of a combined padlock and email. I know we can still do this when we setup the TOTP but we can no longer change it later like we used to do with the v3 app so when I want to reorganise my TOTP accounts, I no longer can.
The other backward step is it is no longer possible to ‘refresh’ the app by pulling down from the top of the app screen. The only way to get a refresh is to force close the app and then open it again. Following  ‘patch Tuesday’ we have to update about 70 servers. This means a lot of authentications within a short period of time. For as long as I have used the app (several years), I have found that it stops responding to push notifications after about 20 or so in a short space of time. The workaround is to refresh the app which then allows the delivery of the ‘missing’ notifications. When dealing with 70 servers it requires quite a few ‘refreshes’. What I could previously achieve with a quick pull down from the top of the screen now has to be achieved with a forced close and reopening the app, something I have to do about a dozen times in the course of a session.
I appreciate that there are a lot more standard users than advanced users but equally I have to use the app a lot more than a standard user. As a systems admin, I am authenticating at least 50 times a day. Why have you made my experience worse!",1

note: this is how it’s always worked - the “view” and “approve” buttons are both semantically affirmatives, and both on the left, so from muscle memory, a double tap should become an approve
ACTUALyou’ve recently, inexplicably, switched the locations of approve and deny, so a double tap now results in a deny
worse, that’s followed by a full screen view saying
note, now the semantics are back to affirmative being first, so pressing that will result in an mistaken, illegitimate suspicious activity report (I would bet if you check your data you will have seen a recent massive uptick in suspicious activity reports - rest assured this is NOT legitimate suspicious activity, or your users suddenly being more vigorous reporters of suspicious activity - it is 100% explained by this UX bug)
MISCNote that this is in addition to the very basic content shifting bug I’ve reported previously
I don’t mean to be uncharitable, but these are very very basic UX gripes and it’s kind of astonishing how Duo manages to botch what can, should be, and in other apps is a very very simple single interaction
see the example of how Okta does itAndroid notification content shifting - #6 by ffriis
note how the whole thing is reduced to a single interaction, ie no need to first press “view actions” before pressing an outcome, completely avoiding the issue of content shifting (which, admittedly, I’m grateful you ended up fixing, but still, it wouldn’t even have arisen in the first place) and completely avoiding this issue i’m now reporting
it’s really unclear why Duo couldn’t use the same simple single press style, optimally with the affirmative approve ON THE LEFT as it always has been before and as it is in virtually all other apps",0

Phone is an iPhone 11 Pro Max running 15.0.2 and Duo app version 4.0.0.41.
Noted: when I delete the app, it says it’s deleting all data, but when I reinstall it comes up with the two accounts it had before - the admin account and user account for RDP/RDG/RDWeb applications. So I’m not sure I’m really clearing the local data, but I don’t know how to do that short of wiping the phone, which I’d rather not do.
Help? Any thoughts or advice? I’m literally getting ready to install a paid account for a client for the first time this week, so I’d really like to clear this up before we move forward.",1

I recently installed Duo for adding MFA to OWA/EAC, and it is working swimmingly for accessing OWA and the admin center directly on my on-prem server. The only issue that can’t seem to find a solution to is when utilizing the hybrid Exchange admin center in O365 to switch from the O365 ECP to my on-premise ECP (clicking the “Enterprise” button on the top left of the page when on the Exchange Online admin center).
The issue is that although I get prompted for MFA, after completing MFA I get blank page with a message “Please ensure that you have cookies enabled in your browser” with no way of moving past that message. It’s not necessarily a deal-breaker as I can pull up my on-prem EAC on a separate browser tab just fine, but it sure would be convenient if I could get it working again to manage both environments in a single tab.

Interested in what an ideal setup looks like for DUO and Google.I understand there is a limitation in using Google for Work as the User Source and then also trying to protect Google for Work (Gsuite) at the same time.The work around is using an LDAP sync or something I believe, but I think this requires a proxy, and we want to avoid having to deploy any kind of services for very small deployments.
We have considered using something like JumpCloud as the Directory Service to replace Microsoft AzureAD. JumpCloud is also attractive as we can do some protection of the PC, Mac etc as well - i.e. applying security policies.
The main point of this post is really to figure out how to get the most out of DUO in a Google environment - while trying to avoid AzureAD.
(Other services we’d like to protect would be Webex, Meraki, Umbrella, AMP, SecureX etc - may be different discussion - but just for context)
I would love to hear from community members as to what they are doing here.
Thanks!",0

You may have learned before that everyone has a “learning style” based on how they process information. We now know that may not exactly be the full story! Everyone actually learns using our own unique blend of all the “styles”, and someone who says they are an “auditory learner” may not necessarily perform better on an auditory test than someone who says they prefer hands-on, kinesthetic learning.
Even though learning styles don’t necessarily have a scientific basis, they are still helpful ways to think about your individual preferences for learning new things! You can think of “learning styles” more like “learning preferences” that are representative of how much you enjoy a particular way of learning.
Self-reflection in learning
Thinking about how you like to learn can help you make decisions to be as successful as possible when learning something, and have the most fun doing it! I have an auditory preference because I like learning new things by having discussions and listening to explanations that are read aloud. It was difficult at first when I started working remotely, because I didn’t have the option of walking over to someone’s desk to ask them a question. I’ve had to adapt to communicating through chat messages more often, but because I know that verbal discussions are most effective for me, I make it a point to schedule short Webex calls with other folks at Duo, so that I still have that opportunity to verbally ask them lots of questions!
(Me typing this post from my couch)
Why are we curious about this?
When we review responses to our Level Up course surveys, we’ve noticed we have Duo admins with all types of preferences. Some folks might ask us to make more videos for a course, while others will share that there are too many videos, and they would prefer to read more! We want to help you be successful Duo admins, and that means we want to make Level Up courses, articles, technical videos, webinars, and more that give you options to learn the way you find the most helpful (and the least boring!)",1

We’ve decided to implement Cisco Duo, and are planning to subscribe to the Access edition.   Our primary goal was to implement Duo for VPN (AnyConnect on Firepower) first, and then for email, which is running on an on-prem Exchange server.   And we have on-prem Active Directory, which I planned to sync users from.
I’ve been reading up on the deployment methods, and saw that we have the option for Duo SSO.   But I’m not clear on, if Duo SSO provides any benefits to us, if we are protecting only on-prem resources.   (We don’t use Microsoft 365 currently, but, may in the future.)
Also, would we be able to initially use Duo with a small group of associates (such as IT) before requiring it for all VPN users?   Currently we use NPS and Radius for VPN auth, and VPN enabled users are in a security group.
Thanks for any guidance.",0

You can find the answer to many of Duo’s frequently asked questions in the help articles in our knowledge base athelp.duo.com, and we’ll be sharing some of them here with you as well.
Today, we’re going to look at why a user might get stuck on “Logging you in…” on theDuo Promptand be unable to complete self-enrollment. This can occur if the user is anunenrolled or partially enrolled userwith a status of “Bypass” in the Duo Admin Panel.
Even if an individual end-user account is in Bypass, Duo is always working in the background and communicating with the application. Because theself-enrollmentprocess happens within the Duo Prompt and authentication is being bypassed, it will never be possible for the user to self-enroll while in “Bypass” status. To resolve this, set that user’s status to “Active” and they will be able to self-enroll via the Duo Prompt.

My Duo and integration with AAD is working great.
However, I see many businesses and colleges using “landing pages” where they can direct their users to authenticate using the campus or business authentication mechanism, then, once authenticated, they are presented with an inline enrollment process.
Is there a “blessed” way to do this? Or are these organizations using a dummy webpage with inline enrollment enabled?
Or are they using the web SDK or perhaps Duo Central?
Obviously this would be for first time enrollment. The goal is to get users devices setup before the actual go-live of MFA for all resources.

I can see the API to sync the directory requires a username be given (as perhttps://duo.com/docs/adminapi#synchronize-user-from-directory), to sync that specific user.
The scenario I have though is this, an AD user has just been created and I want to sync this user into Duo immediately (rather than wait 24hrs). Via the GUI you can achieve this by hitting the ‘sync directory now’ button for your configured active directory, but how do we achieve this programmatically?

I have checked the documentation for downloading on windows live account and the issue with the windows with fall creator update.
I have previously tried to download on a windows where there is just a Microsoft live account, this failed and stopped the user from entering into their account. (bare in mind this is an admin account)
next I added a local admin account and added DUO and then that stopped the user from entering any password for any of the accounts. we had to go into safe mode and wipe data.

I have installed the Duo Authentication Proxy on the server and configured it to use Active Directory as my primary authenticator. I have created a test user and set Network Access Permission to “Allow Access” on the Dial-in tab of the user account’s properties.
The test user successfully connected through RRAS before I started the Duo setup. I have made no changes to Network Policy Server, it is as it came, out of the box. I changed the authentication protocol, on my VPN connection, from MS-CHAP v2 to PAP and I noticed that the type of sign in has automatically changed from “Username and Password” to “General Authentication Method”.
I followed Duo’s knowledgebase article for setting up Microsoft RRAS. I manually created a user in my Duo account with the same username is my AD user.
I have run the Duo Authentication Proxy Connectivity Tool and it reports no errors however when I try to connect I receive the error “The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server. Specifically, the authentication method used by the server to verify your username and password may not match the authentication method configured in your connection profile. Please contact the Administrator of the RAS server and notify them of this error.”
Can anybody suggest how to troubleshoot this issue to determine why the VPN connection is failing?

From what I’ve gathered, all of these browsers now support security keys. Each user is running fully updated versions of Safari and can auth with their Yubikeys in every other situation other than when the native browser is called. Again, our biggest hitters being O365 and GlobalProtect.

Everything is working on the SAML Authentication side.  However, I want the Cisco ASA to check the user name for the Active Directory group (via LDAP) and then assign the appropriate tunnel group in the ASA.
I had Radius authentication set up prior so that the user would login to the VPN, radius would grab their account group name (example: Sales) and then the ASA would assign the appropriate tunnel group.
It seems like with SAML doing the authentication, I cannot get LDAP to send the user group and make the ASA assign a tunnel group. How can I have tunnel groups assigned on the ASA based on the authentication user(group) like I did for Radius but continue using SAML?
The reason I do not want to do Duo with Radius deploy is because I need my users to be able to self enroll into Duo and manage their own devices. The Radius path is a poor experience for end users and a headache for IT.",0

New! Using Device Health Application to verify endpoint trust
Have you heard that you can use theDevice Health Application instead of endpoint certificates to enforce Trusted Endpoint policiesfor some integrations? It’s currently supported withActive DirectoryandJamf pro, and we’ll be adding support for other device management tools soon!
I won’t go into all the details here (you’ll learn them in the course!). But this new certificate-less solution offers a better and more reliable Trusted Endpoints experience for you and your end-users authenticating from Windows and macOS devices. We want to set you up for success, so a large portion of this course focuses on how the Device Health Application verifies endpoint trust and highlights the key differences between the app and older, certificate-based deployments.

I originally thought it was a RemoteApp problem and contacted Microsoft since Duo did authenticate just fine. They pointed out their log shows it’s a problem with Duo.
So, I build a new RDG/RDCB/RDW without installing Duo for RDG and I was surprised that RemoteApp worked flawlessly.

I remember being on a conference over a year ago where this was discussed. Part of that was around the hard-coded 8 hour timeout for RD sessions, which I understand you have release reg keys for overriding. But I would imagine I’m not the only one who is reluctant to do a reg hack for this product that’s a critical part of our infrastructure.
During that call, the message I took away was that you were planning an update for RD Gateway. And, in addition to the timeout, we might be able to regain support for RAP and CAP policies again, which would also be a benefit.
Is there still an update in the works? Is there any kind of timeframe we can be made aware of?",0

I am posting it here as I think it would be of interest to the Duo Community and perhaps help garner support for what I think is a missing feature in Duo.______________________________________________
Duo is truly a very robust and configurable solution. We are current planning a pilot at our company. The one feature that is sorely missing is the existence of a “remember me” feature for Windows login. The same is true for that of RDP logins. As I wrote below, if it’s all or nothing, we have to very reluctantly elect to not at all protect Windows logins with Duo. This is highly disappointing and a glaring omission from Duo’s otherwise comprehensive protection.
I do understand that cookies can’t be saved at that stage of pre-login.[A colleague]said that he spoke to the Duo folks at the recent DattoCon convention. He said that he suggested that Duo could use the IP address to identify a computer and allow it to pass through without Duo challenges on subsequent login attempts. Although it is possible to spoof an IP address, at least give the admins the option to rely on IP addresses to facilitate the “remember me” functionality for Windows logins if they so chose. And if for some reason, this specific approach still wouldn’t work, you have a bunch of clever people over there. I suspect you could figure out a way to make it work.
Although the absence of this functionality probably will not stop us from becoming Duo customers, it has been very close to doing so. Instead of a very strong feeling that we’re comprehensively protecting our users, my feeling would be better described as mediocre. I urge you to prioritize the development of this feature. Duo and its customers – both current and potential – will all benefit.
Thanks,Eli
Hi Eli,
First, I completely understand your concern and you are far from the only person who has them. I’ll try to technically break down all the reason we are where we are right now here so hopefully everyone has a complete understanding of how this works.
As you mentioned, remembered devices works by setting a cookie, which is not possible in the win logon process (no browser).
No way to whitelist based on IP right now.
The ultimate reason both of these things are impossible is because the winlogon tool lives in something called the Windows Secure Desktop, which by design is a type of desktop that is completely out of scope of other application access. We didn’t necessarily choose to do that, but are somewhat forced into it. As architected by Microsoft, the actual Windows login is a subtype of the Secure Desktop, and to interact with that process, Duo has to live at that same layer, because as mentioned the Secure Desktop has no access to applications that live outside of it.
It is true that even in that space, we do have visibility into the IP of the machine, but only as reported by Windows. This is a problem for a couple reasons. It is sometimes inaccurate, and NAT becomes a problem. In essence, when logging into a local machine we only see the LAN address, or when logging into a machine on the same LAN via RDP we also only see a LAN address because of NAT. We don’t support whitelisting private IPs for security reasons. For example, were I to phish your credentials and stole a company laptop (the common concern behind Duo for winlogon) and you had whitelisted a local IP in a policy, I could accidentally or deliberately bypass 2fa. I could potentially be on an open wifi network and get assigned the same private IP via DHCP (unlikely but possible), or an actual malicious actor could just put the machine on a network with a deliberately small DHCP pool.
Simply summarized, we are a bit hamstrung by Microsoft architecture and we’ve deliberately limited one feature for security.
All that said, we have a dev team solely focused on Microsoft integrations and they are constantly looking for another way to solve for this. I expect that in the future we’ll see more login tools because of webauthn and Windows Hello. This is a bit speculative on my part but I know that our internal teams are investigating these tools as a possible path to solving these issues.
Hopefully this helps makes things a little more clear, and helps ease your concerns that it’s not being addressed. Please let me know if you have any more questions.
Regards,Stephen
Stephan, instead of crippling Duo’s protection on Windows login, it would be far better to allow the admins to make the determination whether to trust IP addresses as reported by Windows. We would rather enable such a feature, even if its benefit isn’t rock-solid, than completely leave Windows logins unprotected. (And the other extreme of requiring Duo authentication on each and every Windows login / screen unlock would be an unacceptable burden to users.)
By way of analogy,Duo clearly statesthat SMS authentication isn’t really trustworthy, nonetheless, your documentation says:
We view text messages as better than not having any two-factor authentication, since it still blocks attackers that can’t attack SMS technology.
Granted, the IP reported by Microsoft might be the local IP, but when the request gets sent to your web servers at Duo, you are definitely getting the public IP of the computer. So you do, in fact, have that information. I would never expect you to whitelist a private IP as you mentioned.
And regarding RDPing into a computer remotely, and it causing the same IP to show up on your servers even though the person (attacker) is remote, I agree that’s a concern, but let the client decide if we want to care about that. For example, if I know that RDP is not enabled on my users laptops, then I am fine requiring Duo when outside the corporate office, but not requiring it when inside. Leave the decision to us.
Instead of making the decision for administrators, empower them – along with a warning – to make their own security choices.
Thanks,Eli",1

Is it possible to get a separate callback after a new user hasenrolledtheir first device with Duo?

That button transfers control to the authentication flow and my callback only receives the “AUTH|…” message.
I’d like to run some custom logic when the user completes enrollment, but I’ve never received an “ENROLL|…” message from this SDK. I see the iframe communicating with “/frame/enroll/finish” but I don’t see how my app can be notified of the successful enrollment.

I’m a new admin/user and testing out DUO.  The first application we’ve chosen to protect is Microsoft OWA.  I’ve installed everything and access to OWA is protected.  I get a DUO prompt when trying to login as expected.  When logging into the ECP I get a DUO prompt and am able to login as expected.  If I logout of the ECP and log in again with the same user I do not get a DUO 2FA prompt; the login continues as it did previously without DUO.  If I log out of the ECP and then log into that users OWA account I again do not receive a DUO prompt.  When I log out of that admin’s OWA account and try to get into either the OWA or ECP account I then get a DUO 2FA prompt.
It appears that something related to the ECP is caching/remembering the login even if I logout.  Has anyone tested or experienced this before?
ThanksJosh",1

The user enters his/her phone number and then is presented with a QR Code to activate the account (so, this seems like it is an enrollment and activation bundled into one).
But some users also have an additional account that we would also like to enroll, and since it is owned by the same employee, it will be using the same phone assigned to them from the previous enrollment.  What seems odd to me is that it is using SMS instead of a QR Code to validate the phone when self-enrolling.
Is there a way to force it to use the QR Code method?
And I am asking because we have limited Telephony credits that would quickly get eaten up using SMS for enrolling these additional accounts.
And, as an alternative, I realize that I can assign these secondary accounts as aliases on the original account, but is there a way to automate the population of this field when self-enrolling the original account (account names are predictable)?  If not, I am stuck process of manually adding them every time one of these users enroll using this method.",0

RedesignedDuo self-service portalandinline self-enrollmentfeatures now available for public preview as part of the Universal Prompt Project
You can now preview the redesigned self-service portal experience and inline self-enrollment workflow when using these features in conjunction with theUniversal Promptas part of our Universal Prompt public preview program.If configured for a specific application, the SSP allows end-users to add or edit their available devices from the Universal Prompt. From the prompt, users can access the SSP by clicking on “Other options” and then “Manage devices.” Note that the “Manage devices” workflow now occurs in a separate page rather than within the frame of the prompt itself, in contrast to the traditional Duo Prompt self-service portal experience.You can enable inline self-enrollment for a specific application by configuring the new user policy to require enrollment. Inline self-enrollment allows users who are not yet enrolled in Duo to enroll themselves via the prompt when they attempt to log in with their existing username and password. Note that enrollment via email (either through bulk enrollment or Directory Sync) will still fall back to the traditional Duo Prompt UI for now.Refer to our documentation for instructions onenabling the self-service portal,allowing inline self-enrollment, andenabling the Universal Promptas part of public preview.For more information about which Duo edition features are currently supported as part of the Universal Prompt public preview, refer to thisDuo Knowledge Base article.

Administrator Actions log entries in theDuo Admin Panelwill now display the values for fields that were changed or deleted, if applicable, so that you can compare a change to its previous value.For example, if a user is edited to change a full name, the field will display the previous value as(was [name])after the current name value.

Directory syncs with no selected groups will still be paused but will no longer trigger an email
Directory syncs with no selected synced groups will continue to be paused but will no longer trigger a one-time email to notify administrators. Instead, the Admin Panel sync configuration page will display the message“No groups selected. If no groups are selected, scheduled syncs will be paused within 24 hours.”Note that removing groups from a sync marks any members of that group for deletion if they are not members of another synchronized group. After that, a sync with no selected groups effectively serves no purpose.

We recently added an optional field for pronouns to your community profile page. Pronouns are a shorthand way to refer to someone, such as she, he, or they. An important part of Duo and Cisco’s culture is kindness and treating others with respect, and that includes using the correct pronouns for people. We’ve made that easier to do in the Duo Community now with the addition of this field. You can easily share your pronouns with others if you’d like, as well as see theirs.
Add your pronouns to your profile page
If you’re already a member of the community, you can add or change your pronouns at any time from theProfile section of the Preferences pagefor your user account.edit the pronouns field during or anytime after signup1142×192 2.55 KB
New members who sign up for the community will be given the option to fill out this field as a part of their profile when creating a new user account.
View pronouns on the community
Your pronouns will appear in the user card that displays when you or someone clicks on your avatar in the community, as shown in the image below.pronouns now appear in the community user card1180×496 70.4 KB
Pronouns will also appear at the top of the community profile page, an example of which is shown in the image below.pronouns appear at the top of the community profile page1826×670 82.8 KB
Adding pronouns to your profile is completely optional. This change is to help make everyone feel more comfortable. Pronouns are an essential part of our identity and how we and the world around us refer to ourselves. Using the correct pronouns for someone affirms their identity and shows them respect. Conversely, using the wrong pronouns can be offensive or even harmful. In English, our most commonly used pronouns (he/him and she/her) specifically refer to a person’s gender, while they/them is a generic singular pronoun that can refer to someone of any gender.
Our Community is welcome to people of all identities, including LGBTQ+, and we strive to create an environment in which everyone feels safe to contribute openly and honestly as their authentic selves. Read more aboutwhy pronouns matter here. By adding this feature, we hope to make it easier for our members to express themselves and let others know how to respectfully refer to each other.
I’d like to give a friendly reminder that intolerance will not be tolerated in our forums. Per ourCommunity guidelines, which you can read here, we have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech and inflammatory or abusive language. Abuse against other members due to their pronouns or misuse of this feature will result in deactivation of your Community account. We have already deleted one account due to abuse of this feature.",0

People ultimately decide our security posture – our security is only as effective as our end-users’ comprehension and compliance. In this presentation, we look at the psychology and behavior science of individuals making risk decisions and leaders affecting culture change, and how it affects the security of organizations and the applications on which they rely.
Join Duo Advisory CISO Wolfgang Goerlich on September 29 for insights and pragmatic tactics for improving the human element in risk and compliance.

When connecting to RemoteApps the DUO prompt is hidden, and the only way to reveal it is by clicking the “Show Details” button on the RemoteApp connection window.  My concern is that because this window is not shown by default for RemoteApps, users will not know that they need to authenticate with DUO, and will not understand why they can’t get connected.
Is there a way I can have this login screen shown by default for RemoteApps so that users always see the DUO prompt?",0

I’m using Duo Authenticator on my mobile but trying to move away from Google ecosystem.
The Duo Restore functionality is really neat, but I couldn’t find a way to set it to backup to another cloud service (e.g. Nextcloud) or even locally.
Is there any way of backing up the accounts to a file / folder locally which I could manage as I wish or am I tied to use Google Drive for this purpose? Also if I just back up fully the application data from my Android, would I be able to restore the 2FA accounts as-is?

We are using AD conditional access for MFA with DUO for our Office 365 logins.  Since the o365 access is automatically redirected to the DUO login page,  is it possible that MFA could be bypassed and that the user credentials would be captured by the criminal in this case?",0

New features, enhancements, and other improvements
Changes toTrusted Endpointsconfiguration options
Trusted Endpoints configuration pages in theDuo Admin Panelwill now list integrations that support multiple operating systems as separate entries, rather than in a tabbed interface as before. When setting up a new Trusted Endpoints integration, you will also now select which OS it applies to. This change provides more granular control to create test groups per OS.Additionally, controls to enable, disable, or test an integration with a group have moved from a link at the top of the configuration page to the bottom of the page and now appears as the final step in setting up a configuration.You can now also configure the allow/deny list for endpoints managed throughintegrationsthat use the Duo Device Health application to establish trust. Find the setting on the endpoint details page. The UI is the same as for endpoints that use device certificates.For more information and a recommendation on how to remove unneeded integrations, refer to thisDuo Knowledge Base article. Trusted Endpoints is available inDuo Beyond.

Improvements toDuo Trust Monitoralgorithm
Updated the Trust Monitor algorithm to use more device history insights in order to reduce the number ofSecurity Eventsflagged for unrealistic geovelocity. This change should result in far fewer false positives.

Scheduleddirectory syncswith no synced groups will be automatically paused
Directory syncs with no selected synced groups will now be automatically paused from running scheduled syncs, and a one-time email will be sent to notify administrators. Note that removing groups from a sync marks any members of that group for deletion if they are not members of another synchronized group. After that, a sync with no selected groups effectively serves no purpose.See thisDuo Knowledge Base articlefor more information.

UI improvements to Admin PanelSettings page
Made minor UI improvements to the Settings page in the Admin Panel, including moving the “Inactive admins” configuration option under the Admin Access heading and moving the Save button to the top of the page, where it will float for easier access.

Bug fixes
Fixed a bug where selected groups for a directory sync disappeared from the Admin Panel directory sync page if the sync was already running when the page loaded.Fixed a UI bug where the secret key could not be reset for certain applications. In these cases, the confirmation dialogue would not appear, and the Reset Secret Key button caused a Javascript error without resetting the secret key.

I am trying to set up a Linux (RHEL 8.4) with DUO for user SSH access as well as a local admin user with SSH access and I’ve hit a snag. I have the system configured now to properly MFA users for SSH access, but when I attempt to log in as root via SSH, I am not prompted for a password - the system simply logs me in and drops me at the root prompt. I’m a little stumped here and could use some help. If I modify the sshd_conf file to prompt for a root password, I lose the MFA for the other users. I could really use another set of eyes.

The group policy created with these steps works great.  Now what I am looking for is a way for this group policy to NOT run (and re-install Duo) every time the server or PC gets rebooted.I’ve read up on a way to create environment variables in a GPO and then create a WMI filter to use those variables to check if Duo is installed or not.  That way the GPO will only run if Duo is NOT installed.  However, I’m not very familiar with WMI filters.  Also, the only filter I can find is for .exe files and I can’t find any .exe files for Duo (only .dll files).Does anyone in the community have any experience in getting Duo deployed via GPO and getting the GPO to only run ONCE (e.g. when Duo is not installed)?",0

I’ve started using Duo Free for my home network, and there’s no ability to send an email notification to a new user manually added, so i looked at an email sent to a user using Duo Access. The enrolment link has the format
https://API-HOSTNAME/portal?code=SOME-CODE&akey=SOME-KEY
i can find the API HOSTNAME easily enough, but how to I find out the SOME CODE and SOME KEY values? I’m guessing the SOME KEY is the GUID of the user account but that’s not displayed in the admin console. and how do I find out the SOME CODE?
I’d like the ability to construct my own emails and forward them to the new user for first time enrolment, as I’m only using  Duo Free for securing my RD gateway service for remote access and that does not allow you to enrol during logon.
I initially got around this by setting up a 30 day free trial that allowed my to send email notification, but after 30 days it’s switched to the Free version that doesn’t allow emails, so i can’t add any more users and enrol them.
Any insights welcome, or easier ways to enrol users using Duo Free.

The issue exists when I have two RADIUS servers are configured and the primary one goes down. I know the second one works because I have listed it first and it works without an issue. The issue seems to be with the client time out on the VPN adapter. Ive contacted Meraki support to change the time out value on the Meraki side but isnt enough time to get the Duo MFA push to the mobile device. I get a 718 error about 30 seconds and about 5 seconds later I get DUO push on the phone so I just miss it. Even if I push allow on my mobile device it too late since its already closed out the session.

The watch being on your wrist and unlocked already confirms the second factor of authentication. It seems redundant to have to click “Approve Request” for 2FA on the Apple Watch. For example, when logging into a Macbook, if the user is wearing an Apple Watch, the password requirement is bypassed altogether - no extra steps are needed. The same should be the case for Duo 2FA requests - no extra steps.
This would be a great feature that would make logging in with Duo easier and would take advantage of the unique nature of the Apple Watch as opposed to just treating it like just a tiny iPhone.",0

I wanted to give you a heads up of some design changes that are coming soon to the Duo Community. Earlier this year, we teamed up with some graduate students from the University of Michigan School of Information Sciences to improve the overall user experience of our forum. Based on their research, together with your help, we came up with some new designs that should provide a better overall experience in terms of accessibility and engagement.

We are currently testing out duo for 2 step authentication on our AWS client VPN client and AWS workspaces. So for I have got it to work mostly using a RADIUS server to proxy authentication. I am using authentication proxy for Windows.
Something similar to the below article.
Using Microsoft Active Directory MFA with AWS Client VPN | Amazon Web Services
You can now enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users connecting to an AWS Client VPN endpoint. This solution is ideal for organizations that want additional security when remote users are accessing AWS or on-premises resources. MFA improves...
If I wanted to bypass a user from 2 step authentication I see in duo you can set that setting for that user. When I bring up my VPN client in this case Openvpn, and try to log in, It still asks for a MFA code. Does a bypass code need to be created? What is the correct way to do this?

On both the AWS workspace and VPN client it asks for a MFA code and after that sends a push notification. Do you always need to send that push notification or can we just use the MFA code?

I am also testing with OpenVPN app on the Iphone. When trying to connect It asks me for the MFA code but never sends the push notification to the DUO app. Any idea what might be causing this?

My (documented)config has worked fine over several versions of the stretch based version, but a recent move to buster has seen duo break. I’ve tested a fresh build and config on stretch (no issue), but I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the following error in /var/log/auth.log:Aug  4 15:10:14 pihost sshd[27813]: pam_duo(sshd:auth): conversation failedAug  4 15:10:14 pihost sshd[27813]: Aborted Duo login for ‘username’ from 10.1.1.1: Error gathering user responseAug  4 15:10:16 pihost sshd[27813]: Failed password for username from 10.1.1.1 port 63820 ssh2
I’m using simple username/password. Config as perDuo Unix - 2FA for SSH with PAM Support (pam_duo) | Duo Securityis correct (which is the basis of my documented config), and secrets/keys/url’s all work on stretch when the pi has the same ip address as the buster version of raspbian (so no firewall/DNS issues).

I’ve tried on 2 new Ubuntu 20.04 servers to far and have failed on both. I’m installing from packages, duo-unix. I added the repo and the new GPG key. It installs fine. I’ve edited both /etc/duo/login_duo.conf and /etc/duo/pam_duo.conf to have the keys and such. At this point I try to just test it with:
rob@veeamtest:~$ /usr/sbin/login_duoCouldn’t open /etc/duo/login_duo.conf: Permission denied
Not sure if this is correct or not, but it’s how they are on two different servers after installing:rob@veeamtest:~$ ls -al /etc/duo/total 16drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Aug  2 17:17 .drwxr-xr-x 98 root root 4096 Aug  3 06:28 …-rw-------  1 root root  562 Aug  2 17:17 login_duo.conf-rw-------  1 root root  561 Aug  2 17:10 pam_duo.conf
I am not sure how to edit /etc/pam.d/sshd properly. I don’t require SSH Public Key Auth. But it’s my understanding the Duo test above should work, if Duo is configured properly, regardless if you have enabled it in sshd or not yet.
Anyway, my goal is to have the user test working with /usr/sbin/login_duo and then to enable Duo for standard password based SSH logins. I’d rather not have it protecting console access as well.

In our organization, we have dozens of users who are rotating around to several different computers. That said, since Offline Access seems to need a new key for each computer, I’m leaning towards FailOpen for our users, but I’m wondering how abusable that would be? If somebody cut off access to the Duo Cloud in some way, they’d be able to bypass 2FA.

1001,https://community.duo.com/t/use-fqdn-of-ad-as-host-in-proxy-authenticator-configuration/9755,Use FQDN of AD as host in Proxy Authenticator Configuration,Authentication Proxy,,arwinters,https://community.duo.com/u/arwinters,7/14/2021,"Can you use  the fqdn of the Active Directory Domain instead of specifying the FQDN of all the individual domain controllers you have in your domain.
For example use the config below:
[ad]host=domain.com
instead of
[ad]host=dc1.domain.comhost_2=dc2.domain.comhost_3=dc3.domain.com
It would make sense to create a SAN certificate (only for LDAPs) where you specify the dc’s in the SAN extension attribute of the certificate. And it should work I guess. The advantage here, is that you don’t need to specify the static domain controllers fqdn. Can Duo Proxy make use of this? Or is it really a requirement to specify the DC’s separately.

I’m testing with 1 user that I enrolled in DUO and activated via my Phone.

With Meraki’s does it matter in the VPN settings if you’re using Username and Password?  Should this be General Authentication?

I have everything working with default “push” mode but if I try using append mode - something like “password,123456” it seems to pass the DUO authentication process but fails the VMware authentication which says “incorrect password” and prompts me to type the ‘normal’ password which then passes. I am thus assuming that VMware is being passed the full appended password.
Has anyone got this working or is it a limitation of VMware View. Not sure if its significant but I am using 2FA on the Horizon UAG only not the actual Horizon View connection server.
BTW I have tested with NTRadPing direct to the Duo proxy server and append mode works and succeeds as expected so appears to be a VMware problem.",0

I have used Group Policy to configure 1) the security on the Registry Key, 2) the Log on as a service user right, and 3) the security on the log directory.
This setup works fine – as long as I specify a service account username and password in the authproxy.cfg file (of course, I have to use adifferentaccount here, as the gMSA password is generally considered unknown to humans).
Anyway, the linked article states “[i]f you’ll be running Active Directory synchronization through this Authentication proxy server using ‘Integrated’ authentication, then the account used to start the service must be a domain account with the right to perform LDAP queries against an AD domain controller.”   This to me seems to imply that the LDAP connection would be initiated by the account that is running the service.  However, I don’t see where I can specify an authentication type of integrated.  Essentially, I don’t want to know the password, I don’t want the password stored in clear text, I don’t want the password stored in encrypted text.  I want the service – running under a specified service account – to perform an LDAP bind/query using the credentials of the account that is running the service.
I could settle for using a regular user account (albeit annoying, both because I have to allocate a user licenseandmanage another password), as long as I didn’t have to specify the username and password (in any form) in the config file.

From what I can gather, the documentation Duo has created is for standalone OpenVPN server setups that are possibly Debian based. Since my setup is packaged with pfSense (FreeBSD), the directories are different than what is documented. I’m even noticing that the first step is causing an issue as “make && sudo make install” throws out errors (tried gmake and experienced the same errors). I’m wondering if anyone in this community has experienced this and what work around or documents you referred to? My pfSense 2.3.2 router is built on FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE-p5 and my OpenVPN setup works perfectly fine authenticating locally to FreeRADIUS2 using SSL/TLS+User Auth. All of this is handled within pfSense, there are no other servers or instances that I’m running within my environment I’m just looking to test out Duo with this setup to incorporate 2FA and appreciate any help I can receive around this.

My Cisco switches (5548) work ok, I get the push and I get logged in. The issue is I am logged in at “Level 1” and have no command set. i want to be logged in at “Level 15” so I am a full admin. This seems to require the use of vendor-specific return codes but I cannot find where these are or are not supported within Duo itself.
If I need to do this does it require I set up an separate NPS server? I don’t use NPS right now, the wireless goes to the Internet and no-where else, and the rest of my environment is very simple (small company so not the most involved environment…)
Thanks in advance,

Would like to know if Duo on Windows can be set to only protecting UAC/run as administrator function?
We would like to run Duo on user computers, but we don’t need normal user login with 2FA. We just want to ensure when administrative credential is entered, this action is protected by 2FA and being logged. We would like to do this to ensure the action is done by legitimate admin person instead of stealing password of the user.
Of course the same principle may also apply to RDP with administrative accounts, but that’s another topic after we tackled the local login challenge.",1

We operate a Windows RDS environment and have protection at the rdweb layer and then protection on published applications using the duo-rdp client.We installed the duo-win-login.exe on a session host to protect the published application and added one user to test via ad-sync, however since installing the exe using the following powershell command (using elevated PS),(C:\Windows\Temp\Duo\duo-win-login-4.1.3.exe /S /V"" /qn IKEY=“DXXXXX” SKEY=“XXXXXXXXXXXXX” HOST=“■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■” LOGFILE_MAXSIZEMB=""#100"" AUTOPUSH=""#1"" FAILOPEN=""#1"" SMARTCARD=""#0"" RDPONLY=""#0"""")ALL users whether they were in the Duo console or not now receive the error “Logon Failure. The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer” when trying to open the RDP published application from rdweb.
This error is normally seen if the user is not part of the ‘Remote Desktop Users’ local group on that server but the RDS session collection automatically adds this and they are still in there.This all worked before installing the duo exe.
I have to add ALL users as local admins on the server for them to launch the published app since installing Duo RDP, obviously i don’t want to do this so trying to understand why this happens.
Anyone seen this?Is it because the exe was ran elevated with admin?

In 2019 Cisco began the process of migrating from their previous MFA solution to piloting and rolling out Duo Security. And last year as Cisco’s “Zero Trust for the Workforce” strategy came into focus, the security team began piloting Duo Beyond, building on the foundation of the MFA project to improve device visibility and policy controls for every user and every application. This change would affect over 100,000 users and more than a quarter million authentications each month, so for the sake of business continuity, it was essential that both users and systems were prepared for the switch. Josephina Fernandez and her cross-functional team (including Infrastructure, Endpoint and Infosec) were responsible for planning and executing the project, mapping out use cases and priority and building out the set of policies that would govern login attempts across the business.

I’m pleased to share that in partnership with our Advisory CISO and Security Education teams, our next phase of Level Up will be focused on helping our admins learn more about the world of security!
We know that when your day revolves around putting out fires, it can be hard to keep your own knowledge up to date. Duo admins also come from many different backgrounds, where some folks may be well versed in managing a security program, and others may just be stepping into the role for the first time. The goal with our next round of courses is to bring general security education concepts to our Duo admins, as well as show you some more tips and tricks you can use with your Duo subscription to mitigate risk and improve your own security posture.

Other Level-Up Dates: Course Improvements
Our team has just made some major improvements to our course now titledSetting Up Duo: Protecting Applications. We added 17 minutes of new video content, including a two-part walk through that shows admins how to deploy a proof-of-concept, from setting up the first integration, to configuring a group and application policy to target their pilot users. There’s a lot of information to absorb when you’re first starting out, and we hope this walk-through makes it a bit easier to plan your deployment and configure the authentication experience without disrupting your end-users!

1047,https://community.duo.com/t/google-cloud-platform/9508,Google Cloud Platform,Protecting Applications forum,,pedrotor,https://community.duo.com/u/pedrotor,6/8/2021,"Hi folks,
We currently protect GCP for all of our users.
Over the last few months, 4-5 users have been locked out due to GCP push requests popping up on their phones. They are not explicitly requesting these. The odd thing is that they come up exactly every 5 minutes until they are either locked out or they clear their browser cache (seems to only happen on Chrome). I know that these users don’t actually need access to GCP but are using other Google services like Youtube, gmail, etc.
I’ve posted this in the Google Cloud user groups and they suggest it might be something to do with a refresh token.
I’m just wondering if anyone else has come across this? Also, if I choose to protect GCP for only the users who do in fact use GCP, what behavior can I expect for my other users when they go to login to Youtube, gmail, etc.?
Any advice would be appreciated!

I’ve got Duo set up on Linux using with the RADIUS application and working well. However, for some users, I would like to allow them to login in for some period of time after authenticating through Duo without having to authenticate on each login.
Is there a way to set on a per-user or per-group basis how often the users need to authenticate through Duo?
I thought I had previously seen how to configure this but I don’t see it in the admin panel and I don’t see an appropriate option in the authproxy.cof.
It could be that the option isn’t available any longer since my free trial has expired. This isn’t a big deal since I plan to sign up for a paid plan. If a paid plan is required, which levels support it?

After removing external internet access from multiple VLANs/Individual Servers Duo has started to take 2.5 minutes to bring up the MFA prompt and then another 2.5 minutes to finish logging in after the prompt is answered. This affects all users.
Logs
We found the following in the logs,05/04/21 16:46:082888CDuoCredFilter::Filter: Provider {44E2ED41-48C7-4712-A3C3-250C5E6D5D84} is DISABLED.05/04/21 16:46:082888CDuoCredFilter::Filter: Provider {B7A5BA48-DF88-4F47-B648-64F27990480B} is DISABLED.
Duo’s KB says the following about the respective errors but doesn’t say how to fix it:

Common ThreadsThe issue only appears on Server 2019, and only appears to affect those that had internet access that was then revoked. Deploying a new server to one of the VLANs that had internet access blocked does not result in the same issue, however, two other servers deployed to a different VLAN that then had their individual internet access revoked started to exhibit the same behavior.
SetupWe define our policies via GPO, use a Duo Authentication Proxy and, we have found no examples of Server 2012R2 nor Server 2016 having these issues. Additionally, we have other servers where internet access has been restricted with no issues.  We can see it hitting the proxy in the logs.
**Troubleshooting **We have tried the following with no change:

Completely uninstalling Duo and deleting the reg keys. I found no remaining folders to delete
Changing VLANSWith one of the servers, we attempted to change the VLAN to one that still has internet access. This allowed us to normally authenticate (No delay) while it was on the new VLAN and for a while after we changed it back to the original VLAN. However, coming back the next day it was back to being delayed.
I have not yet seen what happens to a new server that is working when I move it back and forth and if it causes the issue.
ConsolingWe do not require Duo when accessing the console and going in through the console has no delay. Login takes <10 seconds. For this reason and a number of others, we do not believe this to be a domain config issue as Duo Support has suggested on our ticket and in many forum posts.
Firewall LogsWe are seeing no drops in the firewall logs and can see the traffic between the proxy and the problem servers.
If anyone has any insight into this issue we would greatly appreciate it as this has been an issue for us since December 2020, and we have no made much progress working with support over the last month.
Also if there are any logs that would be helpful I will be happy to provide them once I can scrub them of anything sensitive.",0

Not deploying it on the gateway, but will have the Windows logon installed on all workstations and servers.
My desire is to have users listed in Duo admin, send them the enrollment email, and as they enroll then start requiring MFA.  But because RDS doesn’t support the inline enrollment, I have to manually set everyone to “bypass” (or use a group) and then once they’ve enrolled (after x days) I have to toggle them manually to active.
Any guidance or recommendation on automating this process?  I’d like to use AD sync to capture new users but they can’t log in without enrollment… in other words, there is no grace period. As soon as they sync, no access.
We’re about to roll this out so I’m going to A) bulk create the accounts and set them to bypass. Tell everyone they get 2 weeks to enroll.  After 2 weeks, set everyone to active.  That’s OK for the initial bunch but new users have just become a manual babysit process unless I get some better advise from you experts.

So far we have only used push and DUO Tokens which have worked well but this is our first attempt to protect a Windows console logon.
I do like auto push and that would be fine enough however it appears as if Duo 2FA is required each time the system locks. Since we would like an aggressive lock our users would need to complete MFA too many times per day. Even with push notifications it’s too much added work to grab your iOS device and accept the prompt.
To perhaps simplify 2FA we could use YubiKeys so as long as the key is in you can easily complete 2FA. The issue is we feel as if many of our users would just leave the key in the USB port all the time even if we asked them not to defeating the purpose of 2FA.
So, what about some sort of biometric solution? Is there a Duo RDP compatible YubiKey like device that can read a fingerprint real quick? Is hardware fingerprint readers a possible solution? We do not want to go full passwordless we just want an easy and quick way to enforce MFA; easier than push notifications.",0

Set up group policy with all keys and options. Wait for it to sync.
Deploy on each computerwithoutspecifying options:msiexec.exe /i DuoWindowsLogon64.msi /qn

Hello everyone,
Recent updates to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge Chromium impact the behavior of Duo’soperating systems policyfor macOS in a way you may not expect.
What changed?
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge Chromium recently froze the reported version for macOS 11.x.x devices at 10.15.7.
Because of this change, Duo implemented a feature with D215 (released May 6 to 13, 2021)to prevent users from being blocked by OS policy if they are authenticating from browsers that we know have frozen their reported versionsfor macOS 11.x.x.
This change impacts the following browser versions:
Chrome version 90.0.4430 or greaterSafari version 14.0.2 or greaterFirefox 87.0 or greater, or any older version that reports macOS 11.x.x as 10.16Microsoft Edge Chromium 90.0.818 or greater
Chrome version 90.0.4430 or greater
Safari version 14.0.2 or greater
Firefox 87.0 or greater, or any older version that reports macOS 11.x.x as 10.16
Microsoft Edge Chromium 90.0.818 or greater
Suggested solutions
To enforce a policy of macOS 11.0.0 or newer as the most up-to-date OS,the recommended solution is to provision theDuo Device Health application, included in Duo Access and Duo Beyond editions.
On devices running the Device Health app, OS policy is enforced based on the OS version reported directly by the device rather than the browser’s user agent string.
Note:Windows 10 already requires the use of the Device Health application to getfiner version controldue to the fact that a browser agent provides very limited information about the Windows 10 version.",0

As many of us in the security community are aware, a number ofcritical Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilitieshave recently been discovered, prompting Microsoft to release multiple rounds of patches to remediate.
In light of these recent security incidents, we wanted to take this opportunity to remind customers who useDuo for Outlook Web Appthat when you install an Exchange Cumulative Update (CU), you must reinstall Duo for OWA. We recommend you review your Duo for OWA logs to confirm that the integration is working normally. You should see the messageAuthentication succeededfor each login event if 2FA is enabled.
If not, please take the following steps to ensure users are still prompted for two-factor authentication for OWA logins:
Uninstall Duo for OWA (Outlook Web App) completely, and verify that it has been cleanly uninstalled.
Install the Exchange CU. (Note:It is not necessary to re-install the Exchange CU again if you just need to uninstall/reinstall Duo for OWA.)
Reinstall Duo for OWA from an elevated command prompt after the Exchange CU has been completed.
Verify individual Exchange servers with the CAS role that have the Duo OWA module applied aresuccessfully enforcing 2FA.
What happens if you do not follow this process? Because Exchange CU installers overwrite any customizations to the XML files (including those modifications made by installing the Duo integration), users will be able to log in to OWA without being required to perform Duo 2FA.

Duo SSH - Duo can be easily added to any Unix system to protect remote (SSH) or local logins with the addition of a simple pam_duo PAM module. It has been tested on Linux, BSD, Solaris, and AIX. The code is open-source and available on GitHub. Look...
Have skipped the Public Key / PAM configuration section as i won’t be using public key auth.
Have tested the auth and it works fine as per
Open a new terminal putty session and try and login i get the revolving asking for password and not actually accepting the session or asking for 2factor. Rolling back the changes in /etc/pam.d/common-auth allows authentication again.
Any ideas?",0

We are trying to implemente Meraki VPN and FTD RA VPN with ISE and also add DUO MFA , now reviewing the documentation for integration with DUO it says you need to add DUO as external radius Server so that it acts as authentication proxy, does DUO MFA edition requires authentication proxy and local server where PAC file is posted.
Also , it is not clear whether we need to add FTD RA VPN or Cisco ISE with DUO on DUO portal
Workflow is
user->FTD/Meraki VPN->ISE->DUO auth proxy->AD
Above is the general workflow when using RA VPN with ISE and DUO , does it always needs auth proxy ? or there are some alternates using radius token, what is the delay at which user will receive the code on their cell phone
Please let me know if there is any document or suggestions as in some forums DUO mentions to enrol FTD and in some Cisco ISE but my objective is to integrate with ISE and also needs to ensure whether auth proxy is needed or not.

It’s nice to be able to manage our RDG with DUO, but without a RAP policy our entire network of machines is exposed to anyone that breaches the 2FA, which is very concerning.
This has been a known and requested feature for quite some time, and with more companies doing Remote Access, is this problem being prioritized at all? I’ve seen posts from 2016 with users requesting this feature with Duo team members responding that it’s “in the works”. Is it truly in the works? Is there any update anyone can provide? It looks like the last time DUO RDG received an update was 3 years ago.
It is a big nuisance to move away from the DUO RDG now due to how many users we have connecting to work machines, which would mean we’d have to manually install the duo for windows logon on everyone’s machine which is also less than ideal. There has to be some information you can provide on this front? A RAP policy would be a HUGE win for you guys…

Is there a way to setup Duo in such a way that third party TOTP tokens are either restorable from a backup, or, even better, synching across devices.

The updated flow, called Duo Mobile Inline Auth, removes an extra step when interacting with Duo Mobile as part of the device health check.To learn more and see which integrations will use Duo Mobile Inline Auth, refer to thisDuo Knowledge Base article.

Duo Admin APIendpoints no longer return changed legacy parameters onPOST
Legacy parameters can still be sent to the Admin API without error and will continue to have no effect, as stated in Duo’s documentation. However, these values are no longer stored and a response toPOSTmay not reflect what was sent; responses will contain whatever was previously stored in the database. If you have scripts that rely on these legacy parameters, we recommend you update them. In a future update,GETandPOSTwill both return hardcoded values for these legacy parameters.Affected endpoints and parameters are:Create Group (/admin/v1/groups) and Update Group (/admin/v1/groups/[group_id])push_enabledsms_enabledvoice_enabledmobile_otp_enabledCreate Integration (/admin/v1/integrations) and Modify Integration (/admin/v1/integrations/[integration_key])enroll_policyip_whitelistip_whitelist_enroll_policytrusted_device_daysModify Settings (/admin/v1/settings)push_enabledsms_enabledvoice_enabledmobile_otp_enabledu2f_enabled

Bug fixes
Fixed a bug that caused log entries for username aliases to be added to authentications for users who have no aliases. The invalid aliases appeared as a non-normalized form of the username, such as a different capitalization style. This bug affected theAuthentication Login both the Admin Panel and via theAdmin API.Fixed an issue where attempting to download a SAML encryption or signing certificate associated withDuo administrator SAML single sign-onwould sometimes result in being redirected to the Admin Panel login page when switching between a parent account and a sub-account such as those used by Managed Service Providers.

In summary, I am unable to restore the 3rd party apps from backup when migrating to a new iPhone after following the Duo instructions.",0

Use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to \serverthe DUO app launches (able to stay connected on this screen)we complete 2fawe get past DUO and see desktopit immediately disconnects.
This is happening only on one PC.  If I use the same AD user and DUO account on ANY other PC, it works fine.  Also it happens to ANY user on this PC.  Once we disable DUO, it works fine, stays connected with RDP
So it’s definitely an issue with this PC/this PC interaction with DUO.  We have reinstalled duo, RDP is current, all Windows updates are current on client/server, all Dell update are current.
Any suggestions?

I’m really hoping and begging to get direct answers since I can’t find what I’m looking for in self-service searches. I am currently using Duo Mobile on a borrowed phone due to the urgency, and now I need to buy my own phone but on a low budget. I know the app works on Android 9 and up, but my concern is, can the app be used in a clone phone or a class A phone? they are not original, but still have quite good specifications. what if I use it with an android 10, but class A phone? i just need to know, because I might need to order online because malls and cellphone stores are currently close due to the lock down/pandemic, so I will not be able to try it personally.

When non-2FA users try to connect to the VPN, it works fine, connecting the users without the 2FA Duo Push prompt.
When I try with a 2FA user, I get the Duo Push prompt, which I tick, Duo authorizes as expected, but it does not connect to the VPN. Instead, I get an error message on the iPhone saying “A connection could not be established to the PPP server…”
If I remove Duo from the equation(ie set my Firebox to use a different Windows RADIUS server), my admin user connects just fine. ie. the VPN config appears to be fine.
Am I missing something with regards to my Windows RADIUS config?

I have a Watchguard firewall with SSL and L2TP VPN configured on it.The SSL VPN authentication works perfectly well with DUO, but the L2TP VPN fails.When I connect the L2TP VPN, I even get the push notification from DUO and Watchguard shows me the log that the authentication has been successful, but the VPN does not connect.
I showed the configuration to Watchguard and at the end, their support told me these exact words""The trouble you are experiencing with Duo MFA integrated with L2TP VPN, is a known issue with the vendor. There is nothing that can be done on the Firebox to make this configuration work, the configuration is not supported.""
So What should we do now? Is something being done or anything in progress to solve this issue?

I just bought a new phone and I didn’t disable the fingerprint on purpose, as security measurement. The reason for this is that for the police can use the fingerprint and your hand to unlock your phone, while they can’t force you to tell them your password. I rather not have them unlock my phone for free.
So after all I feel more secure safe having it disabled. While the duo app is telling me the opposite. Why does duo even care?",0

Bug fixes
Fixed a bug that caused the message “Unknown Error” to appear in the Duo Prompt when an end-user attempted to reactivate a device with no associated phone number via the Self-Service Portal or Device Management Portal.The country or region selected when a customer’s first Duo administrator account is created will no longer be used to set the Admin Panel’s default date and time. The selected country or region also will no longer be used as the default country for end-users adding a new phone. The UI message that appears when setting up the admin account now clarifies that the country or region information is required for GDPR.Fixed a bug that caused an error when changing an Owner-role administrator to a non-Owner role if the edit was made through a stale request, such as if the administrator account edit page was opened in two browser tabs at the same time.Fixed an issue where users with invalid emails were not removed as part of theinactive user expirationprocess.Fixed a bug where users in Active or Bypass status could beassigned a statusof Locked Out via CSV import.Fixed a bug with administrator activation records that caused administrators in certain cases to see the message “You have not finished the setup process” when attempting to log in to the Admin Panel even though their accounts had been set up. This bug also sometimes caused the message “Activation link already exists for admin” to appear when a Duo administrator was creating a new admin account.

The only leads I have right now is that net.core.somaxconn is being set to 4096 on our host whereas the docker-compose yaml file that DUO provides is setting it to 32768 (this is 8x4096).  It looks like our host node maybe imposing the limits.
Would having the host node impose a lower somaxconn be the cause of upstream timeouts during the set-config update?  I’m working on increasing the value in our environment, however it’s going to take some effort within our environment and I’m wondering what else I can check as well.",1

The user could literally be connecting from any IP based on what network they are coming from. It’s also not really feasible to filter on the firewall based on user group because unlike say a VPN connection with FortiClient, there isn’t going to be a way to check against an AD user group when the user tries to accesshttps://login.microsoftonline.comand instead gets the DUO Access Gateway SSO URL.
I am curious as to how everyone is defining the firewall rule to allow access to the DUO Access Gateway. It looks like I have to define the destination as the DUO Access Gateway with port 443 and set the source field to “any” on the public WAN (Internet) interface of the firewall. Even though the server we built is on a secured DMZ network with only the necessary connections (to LDAP through read-only domain controllers, etc.), I still don’t feel too fuzzy about allowing any and all IPs 443 access to a server in our DMZ environment.",0

User goes for a coffee break or something else, takes a bit of time like about an hour.
Comes back and clicks on ‘Send me a push’.
Gets a red ‘Your session has expired. Please try again’ prompt right at the bottom of the DUO page.
Can’t refresh the page as it is not running in browser but Electron window.

When creating a VPN connection, setting Authentication method in the Security tab in the VPN’s adapter properties to PAP will change “Type of sign-in info” in the VPN connection properties to “General authentication method” from “User name and password”.  If I set it back to “User name and password” and set it, the Authentication methods are all deselected in the Security tab in the VPN’s adapter properties.  From what I understand, DUO requires the auth type to be PAP and a valid username and password needs to be issued from the Windows VPN client, however, this seems to be an impossible combination.  Does anyone have any ideas on a solution?
UPDATE:  I have no explanation as to why, but MSCHAPv2 works.  The documentation states only PAP should work.  Did I miss something?
UPDATE:  I don’t think it works with MSCHAPv2 after trying to reconnect resulting in failure.  If I change the adapter properties to only PAP, even though the VPN client properties are on General authentication with no username and password, it connects.  There is some funkiness going on in the Windows VPN world.",0

I am planning a new Duo deployment and trying to figure out a way to resolve sort of a complex scenario. We will be using RADIUS for VPN authentication.The issues is the customer has 2 AD Domains (different forests) with 2 different VPN Gateways. We will be creating 2 Applications on DUO and have 2 Authentication Proxies/RADIUS services installed (one in each domain) but the problem is some of the users have accounts on both domains and must use VPN to connect to both domains.If we enable AD Sync on both domains, how are the user identities going to be synchronized?

we’re using Cisco Duo within our ADFS Farm (Windows 2019). We’re federating with O365 and requiring MFA for external Access. As long as a usermailbox is located on on-prem Exchange there’s no problem. If the user has a cloud mailbox Outlook keeps asking for password on profile/account generation. I’ve read through this artikel here:Knowledge Base | Duo Securitybut even if I configure the mentioned additional authentication rule ""Example custom rule to globally disable 2FA on ActiveSync and Autodiscover endpoints while requiring 2FA for all other connection types"" it won’t work. As soon as I disable MFA for external access the Outlook profile generation works as expected. Using Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 doesn’t make a difference.Anyone here who has solved this?

I’m just biting my teeth out.
I have the following configuration:
Watchguard Fireall 12.6.4Windows NPS Server W2016DUO Proxy Server W2016
I carried out the configuration 1: 1 as stated on the Watchguard page.
Watchguard DUO
The NPS server was installed and registered in the AD.
If I now specify “authenticate without user verification” in the connection requests on the NPS server for a test, the registration from the Watchguard to the Radius server goes through, the 2 factor authentication works with DUO. Now of course I would also like the password to be checked.
The correct domain user is displayed in the error log, but I get the error message here:
NPS has denied access to a user.
Reason code: 16Cause: Authentication failure due to user credential mismatch. The specified username is not associated with an existing user account, or the password was incorrect.
Since Watchguard only uses PAP, the use of certificates is not necessary here. In addition, I found a relatively large number of possible solutions on the WWW, which I nevertheless tried out on a test basis. The mistake remained the same.
It seems to me that the NPS would not even query the AD, and therefore DUO acknowledges in the log that it does not receive any feedback from NPS.
Maybe someone can help me here.
Best thanks in advance…

Could someone check my understanding of the different terminology Duo uses compared to OIDC?  Integration Key = ClientIDSecret Key = Client SecretAPI hostname = Authority??? = MetadataAddress

1228,https://community.duo.com/t/packaging-authproxy/8540,Packaging AuthProxy,Authentication Proxy,packaging | rpm,modmedcorpit,https://community.duo.com/u/modmedcorpit,1/15/2021,"There’s something funny with the way you go about “installing” the authproxy software in Linux. It’s funny because you basically build openssl and python from source and then copy a bunch of stuff over. Although that “should work” in most Linux environments it’s not the way you’re supposed to install software, at all. Most Linux distributions have package managers, that handle integrity, re-installations, upgrades, removals, etc.
We have successfully packagedduoauthproxy for RHEL7 and compatiblesand in the process of doing so we’ve identified some issues with the upstream code.
Patched code
It all starts with openssl, which is the first piece of software that gets built. Every Linux distribution will have a copy of openssl already installed, but you chose to ship, build, and install this one wich suggests you need a specific version or you added some custom changes, who knows; then cpython gets built. Now, this is a regular altinstall build (it would seem) using the custom openssl BUT the resulting build is way smaller than an altinstall using the official python sources which suggest that it’s heavily customized.
What are those customizations, one might ask? Well, who knows, the source is provided as is, so one has to trust DUO’s openssl and cpython expertise. Here’s a suggestion:
Could you provide the patches that transform the upstream code in your versions?You could make it part of your installation (download upstream + patch) or simply provide it somewhere else, so customers are able to audit the modifications. This is the main paint point in this regard: we’re running critical software (cryptographic engine and language intepreter) with modifications that potentially have very little QA/auditing done compared to the upstream projects as a whole (openssl & cpython). This also applies to the customized python modules that you use (not the ones you own butthe others).
Fake versions
One effect of this customization frenzy is that you end up with custom releases, which would suggest using a custom versioning, but you didn’t go that far. The problem is that you “ship” standard versioned custom releases, which makes the life of anyone trying to identify your software a living hell. Did you modified the code? Is it really version x.y.z? Well, it depends. Sometimes it might be, sometimes it definitely isn’t. Already went over your openssl & cpython issues, and those might or might not be standard versions; the situation in the python packages is just madness. Here’s a simple example:
The duoauthproxy version 5.1.1, and a couple version before it, includeldaptor19.1.0, or that’s what you would think. The thing is that the duo shippedldaptorincludes anmd4submodule that doesn’t exist in the upstream version, which means that the version in duoauthproxy is not really 19.1.0 butsomething else.
Could you please use the version metadata properly?There are several ways to go about it, you can do the trivial-postXsolution, use a custom-duoXmodifier or better yet, work with the upstream project to merge the changes there. By “faking” version numbers you’re making all your shipped packages “special versions” which is harder to audit and package.
Wheels
Not sure why, but you found that the best way to ship python code was to provide the source code. Although it mostly works, this hasn’t been the best way to go about it in the python world for a while now. For pure python modules (most of the ones you use) this is a no brainer: you get X version and build a wheel for it, or you download the already pre-built wheel from pypi, or you just let pip do it for you. For C based modules it might be more complicated (it was onlycryptography, correct?), but it is still better to build a wheel and then install it.
Keep in mind that a wheel is stillthe source code(at least for the pure python modules), so you probably don’t need to worry about GPL & Co. but is way easier to manage than asource tree.
Virtual Environments
This is the intended way to customize a python environment and also to deploy your app. You only need the requirements file, assuming that you can reference the exact version that you need and you can provide the wheels to the non-public modules (not in pypi) although pip can download and build modules in case of missing wheels, if I’m not mistaken; you could even host a private index that pip could use to install your non-public modules (if you, for whatever reason, don’t want to publish them to pypi). With this method your app installer would become a simple requirements file (plus your custom openssl & python, plus some OS scripts, maybe).
Technical debt
There are some development decisions that are puzzling, at the least. Examples are:
user & group are hardcoded into every script that needs it
What if you need to change the user or group for whatever reason? Then you need to change the actual code. A better solution would be to leverage some kind of configuration file and module, likejsonorconfigparseror at least make itan optional command line parameter with a sensitive default.
util.py
I can’t recall where or when, but I’m pretty sure there used to be achdir()call in the root of the execution path in some module (this code here is tosavethe_home_dirbefore the chdir frenzy). Using cwd and chdir is a thing in bash (and other shells) but there are better ways to handle paths in python, namelyos.pathandpathlib. Any of this two modules will allow you to work with absolute paths and derivates which will ignore the cwd altogether (and that’s a very good thing).
Skipping the outdated comment (how many versions ago did you migrated to python 3?) that right there is a hell of an assumption. This code expects your installer to create a non-standard tree where the directories are placed in a specific way. Isn’t the python standard virtual environment tree not good enough? You could at least use a command line parameter with this guess as the default (instead of burying it so deep into the code). BTW, the same assumption is made on the authproxyctl script.
Conclusion
Although we’re able to build an RPM our of yoursource codethere are several changes that you could implement to make the life of all packagers a little bit better. Thank you in advance.",0

I know there is a preconfigured option for the DAG but I didn’t want to have an on prem setup. Has anyone done this successfully? I am very new to the whole SAML thing but I feel like I am 90% there. I defined the application in Duo, I have set up Duo within Smartsheet and when I access the SSO URL for Smartsheet I am redirected to Duo for authentication then when I get sent back to Smartsheet I get an error. If someone has done this before and would be willing to share their settings I’d appreciate it.

We use 2FA authentication for our Cisco Anyconnect Client.  We have our ASA going out to ourapi-XXXXXXX.duo.comand using LDAPS to connect to it.  We are using RADIUS with Cisco ISE.  Everything has been configured long ago and we have been using 2FA for over a year now.
The problem we are having is a timeout issue between DUO and either the Cisco ASA or Anyconnect Client on my users personal computer.
I am able to see successful DUO attempts on the admin portal, I am also able to see authentications successful on Radius.  However the user never gets the Push prompt when they enter push on the 2nd password field on Anyconnect.  I even have the user enter the 6 digit code and still fails.
I had the user login to our O365 portal and they were able to login with their credentials and use DUO push successfully.  It’s just form the DUO servers to my ASA it is not working.  Other users have been successful to use VPN and the sameapi-XXXXX.duo.comserver.  i even created a group without 2FA authentication for VPN and the user was able to connect just by their password and no 2FA.  We even logged in to the ASA web portal to download the client, which requires DUO, and we were able to send a push and login successfully.  It is just the client that has this problem.  I already uninstalled and re-installed and using the latest version on Cisco Download 4.9.04043
We did a packet capture and we don’t see any drops or any sequences out of order from with in the ASA.  On the ASA we saw the public IP of theapi-XXXXX.duo.comserver and did a packet capture to that.  So I am at a lost here and don’t know what is causing the DUO to timeout to the ASA or client.",1

I’m using an Apple Watch 4 (44mm) running the latest watchOS (7.1)
Currently, the push notifications come up on a scrollable screen  with three buttons:  Approve, Deny, and Dismiss.  Since all three are narrow, horizontal buttons, and it’s easy to accidentally scroll the notification, it’s easy to accidentally move the UI elements and hit the wrong button.  I might be more ham-fingered than most, but this happens to me about 1/10 of the time if I’m not careful.
I can think of two possible tweaks that would improve the situation:
Make the Deny/Approve buttons taller and put them side-by side. They’d take up the same vertical area, but would be harder to miss.   I’d also put “Deny” to the left and “Approve” to the right as  that would be easier for right-handed people (righties can use the edge of the watch as a physical reference for one of their other fingers).

macOS 11 (Big Sur) support added foroperating systems policy
The operating systems policy, available inDuo Access and Duo Beyond, now supports devices running macOS 11 (Big Sur).Note that by default, Duo enforces OS policy settings based on the OS version information provided by the user agent string in the user’s browser. However, Safari on macOS 11 is still reporting its OS as 10.15.6. Duo will consider the most up-to-date macOS version as both 10.15.7 and 11.0.0.To enforce a policy of macOS 11.0.0 as the most up-to-date OS, you can provision theDuo Device Health application, available on Duo Access and Duo Beyond. On devices running the Device Health app, OS policy is enforced based on the OS version reported directly by the device rather than the browser’s user agent string.

I have encountered some doubts about the way Duo runs authentication (I integrate with FTD). Duo has three methods Authentication Proxy, Duo Network Gateway, Duo Access Gateway, and I also know that Authentication Proxy uses RADIUS or LDAP for authentication. Duo does the second verification.Duo Network Gateway means to install Duo’s connection tool on the host, you can use Duo Network Gateway use ssh connect to internal networkDuo Access Gateway can be verified through AD or online or Google G Suite accounts online verification service
I want to know what kind of environment these three types should be built in? All three are very similar. I can’t distinguish the pros and cons of each method. I hope I can mention it, thank all",0

1255,https://community.duo.com/t/duo-authentication-proxy-ssl-ca-certs-file-does-nothing/8199,Duo Authentication Proxy,ssl_ca_certs_file Does Nothing? | Protecting Applications forum,,BrianMS,https://community.duo.com/u/BrianMS,11/20/2020,"I recently set up a Duo Authentication Proxy server.The primary authentication server supports plain authentication only, so I had to establish ldaps (or starttls) for the transport.To do that, I have to set ssl_ca_certs_file to a path pointing to the PEM-encoded certificate from the server.
To do that, I fetched the certs with openssl (openssl.exe s_client -connect our.ldap.server:636 -showcerts), then copied and pasted the various certificate blocks into a text file and pointed ssl_ca_certs_file at that file.
This all worked.
Today, I was working on automating this process, because when that cert is changed out we’d have to update the cert that the ssl_ca_certs_file setting points to.  Otherwise Duo wouldn’t work and we’d be locked out of accessing things.  At least, that’s what I thought.
In my testing, I found out that ssl_ca_certs_file doesn’t seem to do anything.  The connectivity tool will check to see if the file is there (and accessible).  It will throw an error if you specify starttls or ldaps for tranport and do not specify ssl_ca_certs_file , and it will throw an error if you specify ssl_ca_certs_file but the file you point to does not exist (or is inaccessible).
It does not seem to check the contents of the file, or check the file against the certificate the server presents.
Similarly, when actually trying to log in, everything works even if ssl_ca_certs_file points to an empty text file, or a text file with random data in it.
Yes, I’m restarting the DuoAuthProxy service after making changes to the ssl_ca_certs_file that Duo is looking at.

1262,https://community.duo.com/t/announcing-the-release-of-duo-trust-monitor/8294,Announcing the release of Duo Trust Monitor,Release Notes,,Kelly,https://community.duo.com/u/Kelly,12/4/2020,"We are excited to announce the release ofDuo Trust Monitor, a risk detection tool that helps Duo administrators identify and act on suspicious user and device behavior that could indicate account compromise.
Duo Trust Monitor uses machine learning to analyze and model user authentication telemetry in order to create a baseline of normal user access behavior. After reviewing typical access patterns in an organization, Duo Trust Monitor highlights potentially risky logins for further investigation. By surfacing contextual information to Duo administrators directly in theDuo Admin Panel, Trust Monitor makes it easy to understand why a login was deemed anomalous.
For example, Duo Trust Monitor can identify and flag such anomalous behavior as:
Novel IPs or devicesUnusual authentication factors or times of dayAccess attempts against high-value applicationsRecognized patterns such as unrealistic geovelocity or brute force attacks
Novel IPs or devices
Unusual authentication factors or times of day
Access attempts against high-value applications
Recognized patterns such as unrealistic geovelocity or brute force attacks
To help improve Trust Monitor over time, you can provide feedback on the surfaced events by marking them as suspicious or dismissing them. Marking an event as suspicious helps Duo Trust Monitor data science improve model precision by adapting its understanding of what constitutes normal behavior for a user.
Duo Trust Monitor is available at no additional cost onDuo Access and Duo Beyond editions.
To get started using Duo Trust Monitor, log in to the Admin Panel and go toTrust Monitorin the left sidebar. We recommend setting up aRisk Profilefirst. Your Risk Profile will tell Trust Monitor which applications, user groups, and locations/IPs are highest priority.
Within one to two days, you will start seeing Security Events flagged by Trust Monitor appear in a dashboard in the Admin Panel, where you can triage and investigate. Over time, Trust Monitor helps you gain visibility into your environment and harden your security posture byadjusting or adding policies.
Here are a few frequently asked questions about Duo Trust Monitor, and we invite you to comment below with your own question!
What data does Trust Monitor have access to?
Trust Monitor analyzes only Duo authentication data and administrator actions (such as surfacing when a user is put in bypass status). To see which data points Trust Monitor reviews, refer to thedocumentation.
How long does it take to set up Trust Monitor?
You can designate your Risk Profile in the Admin Panel in a few minutes and start seeing Security Events in the Trust Monitor dashboard in one to two days.
I’m a new Duo customer. Can I still use Trust Monitor?
Trust Monitor may leverage up to 180 days worth of historical Duo data to define a baseline. However, organizations don’t need this much data for Duo Trust Monitor to be useful. We recommend customers enable the feature after using Duo in their environment for at least six weeks.
Can I use Trust Monitor in conjunction with my SIEM?
Yes. Trust Monitor is a powerful complement to other security applications such as a SIEM, which can be configured to programmatically ingest event logs using various methods, including via theTrust Monitor endpointfor the Duo Admin API.
Will Trust Monitor ever block my users?
No. Trust Monitor does not block logins. It only surfaces information for you to review and take action on as needed. In the future, Trust Monitor’s insights into user access behavior may help inform an adaptive authentication strategy as part of a future Duo product offering.

Duo 2FA will then continue to work for some period of time (week(s), multiple logons, etc.) and then will stop working again, prompting the reboot.
I’ve looked at the logs and everything stops when Duo calls an API atduosecurity.com. The next entry in the log is the next attempt at logon. Goes through the same steps, and again stops at “making request” to theduosecurity.comAPI.

We need to have Duo protect Connectwise Manage, which I’m told we can do (even though no one currently supports it) via SSO/SAML 2.0 using DUO’s generic SAML service provider.
I set up a DAG server thinking that was the best way to go, but now I’m not so sure. I’m having trouble determining if DAG and ADFS work in tandem or if they are different ways of doing the same thing.
I was under the impression I could just install ADFS on our Domain Controller and link it up to the DAG server, but that doesn’t seem to jive with anything I am now reading.
Would DAG fit somewhere on this network map?https://duo.com/docs/adfs#deployment-overview.

This is working great, but I’d like to add Duo Security as mfa.
I followed bothWG guideandDuo RADIUS guide, but I’m having connection problem.
Everything seems to be working as intended (vpn is connecting, I get prompted on my mobile to approve/deny the connection request) until I tap on Duo mobile green checkbox, then I get disconnected. The error on the WG device is ‘user isn’t in the right group’.The problem seems to be very identicalto this post..
I tested some more by connecting the Duo Auth Proxy radius to NPS. The event viewer on the NPS confirms the connection is access granted, but the WG disconnects. This tells me NPS authentication server approves the login with correct user and password, but WG device did not get the message of approval.
I believe the problem is the Duo Auth Proxy is not sending back “filter-id” property to the WG device upon approval on the Duo mobile app. The filter-id contains the user group property where the WG device expects it when the connection is approved by the NPS. When the WG device doesn’t receive the filter-id, it would assume the connection is not authenticated hence disconnection.
How can I get this to work?",0

I am trying to integrate DUO Web V2 SDK to our existing Sharepoint based login Page. The page is developed as a custom module using Microsoft Membership Provider.
In order to do this, I followed the DUO libraryhttps://github.com/duosecurity/duo_dotnet. I have integrated DUO UI by adding the below code segment as the documentation.
Duo.init({‘host’: ‘host’,‘sig_request’: ‘sig_request’,‘post_action’: ‘Landing.aspx?pages=1’});
For the post_action I called the same page with an additional parameter to recognize the Postback is from DUO. Even though it gets called as a post_back, thesenderor theeobject does not contain the response from DUO.
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){}
Additionally, As I saw most of the articles, the post _action mentions a URI (Method endpoint) which defines in MVC. But in our case we don’t use MVC and we use SharePoint server-side web part which usesASP.net.
Could any one help me to resolve this?

However in 5.0.0 there is a bug whereby the Message-Authenticator attribute is copied rather than being re-generated.
After pointing my Fortigate to a Duo Auth Proxy between it and FreeRADIUS, PAP authentication works fine (e.g. SSL VPN) but IKEv2 is unhappy.
Enable debugging on the Fortigate
And note the smoking gun
A packet capture on the Duo Auth Proxy server shows that the Message-Authenticator attribute is just being copied. Time to dig into the source.
duoauthproxy/lib/radius/server.py
Hmm, this looks relevant. What if I try to re-generate the Message-Authenticator attribute after Duo’s finished mangling the message.
Voila! Now the proxied RADIUS message can be authenticated by the Fortigate and IKEv2 VPNs work regardless of which auth method is used.
Hopefully this can be incorporated into 5.0.1 and released soon

This setup works fine but we have noticed that after implementing this configuration, users with upcoming expired passwords are not warned about the same.  Also, once user passwords are expired, it renders this mode of connecting to VPN useless and requires an admin to reset their password on AD.  This worked fine before implementing DUO for auth and 2FA.  Am I missing something here?  I have password management enabled on the connection profile on the ASA.

We’re using the proxy so we can use Duo for vSphere (6.7).
vSphere is set up with an identity source that has details for our active directory and points to our proxy. I can create the identity source and search for users and add them to roles in vSphere.
I tried logging in as myself (from that identity source) and was surprised to see it work but without the 2FA prompt.
I then found this:https://help.duo.com/s/article/4989?language=en_US
The behavior is exactly what I experienced.  So I went ahead and set exempt_primary_bind=false and exempt_ou_1=[dn of our service account].
Then when I tried to log in, vSphere reported a generic “invalid credentials” message, and authproxy.log showed “Cannot find username”.
Any ideas?  I’m not sure why it’s showing “Cannot find username” or what part of the process is actually throwing that.  Again, I can log in fine (without 2FA) if I leave out exemp_primary_bind and exempt_ou_1.  Additionally, if I add exempt_ou_2 and set it to the DN of my username, I can log in again (with 2FA bypassed), so I believe I’m specifying the DN properly for exempt_ou_1.

I’m thinking#1stillrequires communication between a DUO user and the DUO cloud service,  but wondered whether#2might not require the user contacting the cloud service.
Reason I’m asking here, is I suspect a recent problem may have been related to internet connectivity,  as one of the symptoms users experienced was they received their DUO phone requests late,  or were able to respond to a DUO request, but never completed because the application (our VPN login)  timed out because of the slow round-trip.

Not totally sure if I’m using the forum correctly but I wanted to throw a small suggestion into the mix.  Forgive me for semi-informal terminology since I’m not a developer, but I’ll try to be as specific as possible.  Duo Push notifications on phones (understandably) have a “tap to view actions” prompt, presumably meant to avoid accidentally approving a login request while interacting with notifications.
The same prompt appears on Android Wear/WearOS watches.  The flow of interacting with notifications on WearOS devices makes this process a little slower than it needs to be.
I wanted to suggest removing the “tap to view actions” prompt on WearOS notifications in favor of a notification with “nested” button prompts to allow or deny the login.  WearOS already supports this natively - for example, Gmail will show only the notification details in your WearOS notification bar, but will reveal button prompts to reply or archive an email when you tap the body of the notification.
I appreciate WearOS support being implemented at all, and I think this small change would significantly improve the flow of utilizing Duo Push on watches.",0

We have begun requiring DUO as an authentication layer for some of the website applications. This caused our web checks (http post commands) to fail. Even after getting an exemption set on the ID we use for the http post requests, we still have failures. After capturing and analyzing the packet flow, the request was redirected to DUO and as part of the authentication/exemption process it was determined that javascript/iframes was being used as the handoff process even for exemptions. Since we are using http post commands, there is not a full browser environment available for this type of interaction.
If we connect interactively as the batch ID from a browser with javascript enabled, the target website is reached without the DUO authentication layer being required which validates that the DUO exemption for that ID has been properly set.
I am looking for guidance on how to address this issue when needing to access a DUO fronted website through http post (batch, unattended) requests.

I thought I would post this here, and I will cross post on Meraki as well in hopes it will save someone some grief.Background - Client using Meraki Client VPN with DUO, works fine. Client wants to add a new VLAN/Subnet than all of a sudden DUO stops authentication with the new Subnet “IN VPN”. If you don’t add the new VLAN/Subnet into the VPN it works fine.
Called Meraki support and asked if the IP address (source to Auth Proxy) would change by adding a new VLAN; the answer was no the IP should stay the same.
Took a sniffer trace with and without the new VLAN and found the IP address of the Meraki did change, so we had to add it to the allowed sources in the Auth Proxy config. Then it worked.
Verified with Meraki the (for some unknown reason) that it takes the highest VLAN numbers’ IP address as the the SVI for the Meraki Client causing the source IP address of the Auth request to come from the higher IP address.
I hope this makes sense, if not let me know.",0

We are a small IT company and provide IT-services to our customers. Now we want to give a 2nd factor for RDP sessions to some of our customers.
We are very new to Duo and have tested a Duo Free account for ourselfs. The test period was successfully.Now the question is: what is the best practise to roll out Duo to our Customers. There are some companies who will need like 5 users. There are some companies who need 10 or more users. And there will be some companies that will need just 1 user.
We want to use the D-100 token from Duo for every user.
Do I have to create a new Duo Account for every customer? I think yes - even if there is just 1 userShould I order 10 D-100 tokens from my own Account? I have to move the single tokens from my account to the Customers accounts? For example I will order 10 tokens and move 2 tokens to Account A and 3 tokens to Account B and so on…?For every move I need to E-Mail tosupport@duosecurity.com- but my own account is a free one. Am I allowed to use the support?
In short terms: what is the best practise for me?

At the moment al authenticatinos are done vi LDAP to our AD service.
I look after our clearpass  Policy manager that we use for all our network authentication ( RADIUS/TACACS) and am keen to implement 2FA for network switch access.
I downloaded an evan version of duo proxy and with a bit of tinkering have got it working for all our ComWare/ArubaOS and ArubaCX switches.
The problem of course is that this is in a dev lab with just my clearpas servers and the duo proxy  where I can tinker with things as I like.
For TACACS the sequence of events areSwitch passses rtacacs auth to cleaarpassclearpass uses an auth source “Token Server” to pass auth request to the Duo proxyDuo performs a radius auth against  clearpass to validate the user conecting to the switch  ( and does what it does for 2Fa)Clearpass returns an access acceptInital TACACS auth completes with an acceptClearpass passes appropriate TACACS attributes back to the switch to log user in as read only admin, read/write admin whatever … simples! … in a dev environment
My problem is that systems are usi g a default “use ldap” to auth the user so  the above wont work.Also production wise, there will be lots of “hosts” using the duo proxy  and probably simple  ldap auth will be satisfactory
So from the “Duo Auth Proxy Reference”
Under “Client Sections”
If youv’e created an [ad_client] and a [radius_client]
Can you select which one to use based upon who is passing you an auth request  eg …
If a clearpass server with an ip address of a.b.c.d passes an auth request to the proxy use your defined [radius_client], if a web vpn service contacts duo, use the [ad_client]
If th above were possible I could use the system managed DUO procy for  TACACS  2FA  without having to managed my own DUO

My user is a Microsoft account and I added the local user identity to my Duo user as an alias to avoid an additional user registration.
I am able to login without Duo on the machine directly.Logging in via RDP I get the Duo login screen and push notification.
The problem happens when the session times out and goes to the lock screen. Instead of displaying any user information the screen is fuzzed out how it would normally present with the user login to re-authenticate. No options are available except for the user accessibility options and the disconnect button.
Reading further I found that with a Microsoft account you need to set the group policy do not remember the last login ‘Interactive Logon: Don’t display username at sign-in’ option. I didn’t set this feature since I’m not using Duo for direct logins, only RDP. Poking around I found a similar setting ‘Interactive logon: Display user information when the session is locked’. With some testing, I found the settings below work after testing each policy and combo.
For DUO RDP Only setting
Interactive Logon: Don’t display username at sign-in = ENABLEDInteractive logon: Display user information when the session is lockedUser display name, domain and user names = BROKENUser display name only = WORKSDo not display user information = WORKSDomain and user names only = BROKENInteractive Logon: Don’t display username at sign-in = DISABLEDInteractive logon: Display user information when the session is lockedUser display name, domain and user names = BROKENUser display name only = WORKSDo not display user information = WORKSDomain and user names only = BROKEN

1312,https://community.duo.com/t/how-transfer-duo-mobile-to-new-ios-device-end-user/3815,How transfer Duo mobile to new iOS device? End-user,Duo Mobile app forum,,S_C,https://community.duo.com/u/S_C,1/10/2019,"Hi, I have been using Duo to store 2-factor passwords for various websites. I am not part of an “organization” and there is no administrator. All the help docs seem to assume I have this?
I backed up my old phone using iTunes, then restored to my new iPhone using the restore feature.
Duo is there, but when I open it, it is empty and does not have my 2-factor auth. listed.
Pages like this one assume I have an admin panel? But the mobile app does not provide this:https://help.duo.com/s/article/duo-restore?language=en_US
There is no “company” to reconnect to, the new phone just says:
“Welcome to Duo mobile”
Add account (which brings up the QR code scan) and that is about it.
The old phone is still under my care, but I do not see any options there either to add a device.
Is there just no way to transfer passcodes between my two phones since I am a consumer (not attached to an organization) instead of a user part of a admin account system?
I have like 20 passcodes on this phone, so it would be a real pain to have to re-configure all of them manually on all 20 websites.
Thank you!",1

New, easier workflow foradding Duo administrators
There is a new method for adding administrators to Duo that allows Owner-role administrators to create a new administrator of any role, generate a setup link, and then allow the new administrator to complete their own account setup, including setting their own password and activating Duo Mobile.A banner has been added to the Add Administrator page in the Admin Panel to describe the new process. From this page, Owner-role administrators can check a box to automatically send the new administrator setup link via email. Alternatively, Owners can choose to send the email later, or copy-paste the link to send it through another channel.Administrator setup links expire after 1 week, and can be invalidated or recreated at any time by an Owner.As part of this change, Owners will no longer be able to set a new password for an administrator who has forgotten their password. Instead, Owners will be able to copy-paste a link from the administrator’s details page where the administrator can reset their password. The action of viewing the reset password link for another administrator will be recorded in theAdministrator Actions log.TheAdmin APIhas also been updated to support the new administrator provisioning workflow.Refer to thisDuo Knowledge Base articlefor more information.

Duo Single Sign-On is a cloud-hosted SAML Identity Provider (IdP) that adds two-factor authentication, complete with inline self-enrollment and the Duo Prompt, to popular cloud services like Salesforce and Amazon Web Services using SAML 2.0 federation. Duo SSO supports on-premises Active Directory (AD) and cloud or on-premises SAML IdPs as identity sources.
By allowing users to access multiple applications with a single username and password, Duo SSO helps mitigate the risk of bad password habits while making it easier to work flexibly. You can even create access policies that can differ by application, depending on the sensitivity of its data and the privileges of the user, which reduces user friction while protecting your most important assets.
Duo Central is a cloud-hosted site users can visit to get access to all of your organization’s applications and links. By uniting all tools under one interface, you make it easier for users to find important resources.
duo-central-example1600×1023 124 KB
Duo Central displays both Duo-protected applications and any other resources you wish to link to as individual tiles, known as Application Tiles and Bookmark Tiles respectively. Tiles are completely customizable with the ability to add a custom logo and even limit visibility to certain groups of users with Permitted Groups. Tiles can be edited and updated at any time.

i have installed Palo Alto Globalprotect and use duo push for my users, this works great - user authenticate trough windows (username/pass) and verify w/duo push on smartphones.
But now there are some users that dont have smartphones and maybe dont have phones. I tried to add yubikey hardware tokens and U2F but i dont seem to get how this should/could co-exist with the current configuration. That is working.
Is there a easier way to do this, with users that dont have the possiblity to use phones - just authenticate w/yubikey hw token/u2f device.

Bug fixes
Updated a label on the Admin Panel Settings page to “Country/region” instead of “Region” to better reflect its purpose.Fixed an issue that caused an administrator to lose their data input when editing a user in the Admin Panel if the input triggered an error message, such as a username alias conflict. Now the input will be preserved and the error will appear below the field to provide additional context.Fixed a bug where a user failed to sync via directory synchronization when their LDAP distinguished name (DN) was longer than 256 characters. The character limit has been increased.Fixed an issue where the UI displayed a success message for a single-user sync via directory synchronization that actually failed due to a collision in usernames.Fixed a bug where creating an invalid administrator password and then saving the page did not automatically scroll to the top of the page to show the error.The Authentication Log now correctly returns WebAuthn as an authentication factor via theAdmin API. Previously, logs for WebAuthn events were returned withfactorslisted as null. Note: This issue did not impact the Authentication Log in the Admin Panel.

Issue
I would like to “Remember for 30 days”, but cannot.
On the 2nd-factor iframe embed, cookies cannot be used (to “remember for 30 days”), because I have not approved the Duo domain,api-XXXXXX.duosecurity.com, (and cannot easily(?) do so). I’m seeing the issue in Safari (14) with Ghostery, which may not properly handle trusting embeds of a trusted site (Duo) within a trusted site (my auth provider).
Key point of confusion
Since the Duo hostname isapi-[hexchars].duosecurity.com, I’m not clear whether the subdomain is a unique (v-)host for my whole company, or just a random API endpoint. And I don’t feel confident enough guessing what your architecture constraints are for security & external integration.

New Course: Enforcing Trust-Based Access with Duo Policies
The#1request we received from our beta participants was for us to make a more in-depth course about using the Duo policy engine. I’m pleased to introduce our latest course offering:Enforcing Trust-Based Access with Duo Policies! This course is all about using policies to design, enforce, and monitor trust-based access based upon your organization’s user population and risk tolerance.
While our first policy coursePolicy & Access Control for Everyoneintroduced the five core policies available in every edition of Duo, this course predominantly focuses on policies for Duo Access and Beyond editions. It features 24 modules, and even has a couple new interactive features. Our team had a lot of fun putting this together for you and we can’t wait to hear what you think!
Device Trust Certification Program in Development
I’m pleased to announce that our upcoming certification program will beDevice Trust! Our goal with this series is for administrators to be able to establish, enforce, and continuously monitor device-trust based access in their environment, and will include:
Enforcing Trust-Based Access with Duo PoliciesDevice Health Application Course (In Progress)Device Trust Certification Exam (In Progress)

Recently I was switching phones quite frequently and hence I used the “On call 2nd factor auth” feature until I got my new device rebonded.
I noticed that every time I have to use on call otp, the Indian numbers cannot take the press of number X(used for confirmation/authentication).Hence the call times out and I have to redo the authentication.
Then for the second/third time Duo falls back to a US phone number and that can take the input and finish the authentication.
Points to remember:
I don’t think my cellular operator is at fault here because the US call does take the DTMF code.

Curious to hear what you (as MSP’s) are talking about to your customers who give you the “it’s included with our MS agreement” line and how you explain the benefits of DUO over MS MFA?
We come up against this a lot, and cost always seems to be the driver, that or it “seems” simpler to go with Microsoft.

New service reliability feature will gate authentication requests in rare scenarios where an outage could occur
If a Duo deployment experiences latency in authentications averaging 4 seconds, Duo will deny some new inbound authentication requests in order to preserve Duo’s service.This scenario occurs in rare cases and allows Duo’s service to clear the queue of authentication requests while avoiding an outage.In the event of an authentication latency issue, users will see an error message when trying to access the Duo Prompt or in Duo Mobile. Applications that use the Auth API will receive a standard 429 Too Many Requests error message.See thisDuo Knowledge Base articlefor more information.

They have users with Windows build 18363, which appears to date to December, and is otherwise still supported.  That release, if fully patched, has Edge 18.18363.  Duo is blocking this as out of date, even though they’re on a supported Windows build and that’s the current version the computer receives when fully up to date on patches.
Is there any workaround for this besides either upgrading every client desktop to 19041, which just came out <2 weeks ago, or turning off the out of date browser block in the policies?  The latter unfortunately would affect all browsers since Duo doesn’t let you differentiate by browser, and turning that off for other browsers could be fairly dangerous.",0

As part of our normal rolling release cycleSeptember 14 through September 24, 2020, we have added a section on thePayment Infopage in the Duo Admin Panel calledTax Informationto collect your VAT (value-added tax) number where applicable.
The Tax Information section appears on the Payment Info page under theBillingtab. This sectionwill only appear for customers who pay by credit card and who are based outside the U.S.In this case, a VAT number will be collected for credit card payments for both Duo service and for hardware token or telephony credit purchases — again, only in applicable countries.U.S.-based customers will not be asked to enter a VAT number.
vat_data_entry480×604 3.28 MB
We are making this change because Duo is required to report the VAT status of its customers to comply with some countries’ tax law. Note that in some countries, VAT is known as GST (goods and services tax).
The Tax Information section contains two fields:VAT NumberandBusiness Name. If your organization does not have a VAT number, you will be able to note that in the available fields.
The fields in the Tax Information section arerequiredfor all non-U.S. credit card customers. New customers will be required to enter the information when they enter their billing information for the first time. Existing customers will be required to enter the information if they update their billing information.
Once a VAT number is entered, it will be displayed at the bottom of the Payment Info page under a label calledTax Information.",1

1367,https://community.duo.com/t/duo-azure-conditional-access-hybrid-sso-skipping-mfa/7709,Duo + Azure Conditional Access,Hybrid SSO Skipping MFA | Protecting Applications forum,azure | conditional-access,ahoivik,https://community.duo.com/u/ahoivik,9/16/2020,"Disclaimer:I apologize if this question has been asked previously, I at least attempted some due diligence.
Environment:We have an On-prem AD Environment synced to our Azure AD tenant,  with hyrbid join enabled for workstations and sync for user/group objects. Nothing exciting there.
Our AzureAD domain is Federated with PingFederate IDP - this results in users logging into SAML/OIDC protected applications being redirected to our IDP vs using the Microsoft Azure Native login page.
And finally, we have Duo Integrated into Azure Conditional Access as a custom MFA control, and have our campus IP space marked as trusted to avoid MFA prompts when internal.
Ping as IDP workflow:App > Ping > Duo for Ping > App
Azure as IDP workflow:App > Azure Redirect > Ping > Duo for Azure via CA > App
Problem:Once we started to Hybrid join our workstations to Azure AD (which automatically enables Azure SSO functionality), applications that we protect with AzureAD via SAML (Cisco AnyConnect for example) do not prompt users for DUO. The application is SSO’ed by the JWT on the Hybrid joined device and away they go. I mostly understand the WHY behind this - the Windows auth token is considering me a valid user as I made a MFA logon to another Azure protected App recently and is marking me as “good to go”.
The question is, what mechanisms do I have that would allow me to FORCE a duo prompt to the user for certain workflows in the event I needed to? So far the only way I have gotten this to work is by implementing a session duration limit of 1 hour on some applications. The end result is that users that login to the windows GINA have 1 hour to SSO into an application before they are prompted. Its pretty cheesy.
I realize this is a AzureAD/Conditional Access issue and not a DUO issue. I am asking this here in case someone else has come up with a neat workaround. It appears AzureAD treats 3rd party MFA significantly different in these workflows then their own MFA.
SummaryIn summary, AzureSSO (enabled by the Azure Hybrid join process) will skip the 3rd party MFA custom control in conditional access at its leisure, and I cant figure out how to FORCE duo to prompt for workflows we require.",0

A yubikey has worked in firefox for months using an add-on, and with firefox 57 released a few weeks ago the u2f support is native; it works with many 2fa systems but not yet with duo.

i have heard of people using a user-agent switcher to spoof chrome, then supposedly duo will work with u2f keys, but i have not tested this and prefer not to use this regularly.

I have IKEv2 VPN working fine with Windows 10 IKEv2 client when using only RADIUS and no Duo. My NPS server is set to use only MSCHAPv2 and not EAP-MSCHAPv2, so I don’t think that lack of EAP-MSCHAPv2 support is the issue, i.e., IKEv2 VPN connects without it in my NPS server settings.
When I throw Duo into the mix, I try to log into the IKEv2 VPN, I get the prompt on my phone and allow it, and the VPN rapidly says “Cannot connect to…” my IKEv2 VPN name. In FSM traffic monitor (with Authentication set to Debug level), I get a line stating:
2020-03-04 21:50:12 iked msg=ike2_StoreMSCHAPv2Result: Received authentication result does not have the expected content Debug
What does “Received authentication result does not have the expected content” mean? I have no idea and Google searches come up with nothing helpful.
Can Duo work with an IKEv2 VPN that works fine using only MCHAPv2 for a plain-RADIUS connection?

Updated UI for username aliases onUser pagesandDirectory Syncpages in theAdmin Panel
The UI for adding username aliases in the Username Alias section of a User details page has been updated to a dropdown select field to make it easier to add or edit aliases in any order.This UI change mirrors one described in theAugust 14, 2020 release notesfor username aliases in theSynced Attributessection of a Directory Sync configuration page.In addition, Duo administrators can now more easily change the position of a username alias (e.g. Username 1 -> Username 3) by using the dropdown select field, rather than needing to copy and paste the value into a different alias field. This improvement applies to both User pages and Directory Sync pages.

Bug fixes
Fixed an issue in which two log entries in theAdministrator Actions Logwould be created each time a Directory Sync configuration was updated, no matter what the change was: An entry recording a change to groups, and an entry indicating the directory itself had been updated. Now, the Administrator Actions Log will record an entry for a group change only if a group was actually changed. Changes to other directory settings will still be recorded as a directory update.Fixed an error that would occur if a Duo administrator using single sign-on to access the Admin Panel hit the back button while performing Duo authentication. Now clicking the back button will start the login process over.Fixed an issue where non-Owner role Duo administrators could see but not filter actions taken by other administrators in theAdministrator Actions Login the Admin Panel.

AD users are placed inside a “Duo Security Users” group and that group is synchronized into Duo Admin.  That group provides access to the OWA Application.  We have a Local Subnet Bypass policy configured that bypasses 2FA if OWA is accessed from a device inside the local network.  This all works great.  My question is this.  I removed the Domain “Administrator” account from the “Duo Security Users” Group and that account is no longer synced into Duo Admin.  After I did that, the Administrator was no longer able to login to OWA EVEN though subnet bypass is enabled.  Does a user account have to exist despite having a subnet bypass set?  I was under the impression that since a subnet bypass policy was set, that ANY user, despite NOT having an account synced into Duo could access the application because 2FA is ignored for that subnet.  Perhaps I’m not correct and ANY user needing access to OWA must have an account in Duo and that a Duo license will be consumed by that account despite having subnet bypass policy applied.  If I add the Administrator account back into the group and synch it, then that user can login to OWA.",1

We are happy to announce thatversion 5.0.0of the Duo Authentication Proxy has been released, with support for LDAP Signing plus LDAP Encryption (also known as“Sign and Seal”) for thentlm2andsspiauthentication types using CLEAR transport.
First, please note that theAuthentication Proxy binaries for Windows have been migrated from 32-bit to 64-bit. Duo supports installing the Authentication Proxy on Windows Server 2012 and later, which are 64-bit operating systems.
The installation file path has been changed accordingly:
Old path:C:\Program Files (x86)\Duo Security Authentication ProxyNew path:C:\Program Files\Duo Security Authentication Proxy
If yourauthproxy.cfgfile contains any references to the 32-bit installation path, for example, if you specified the absolute path to your SSL certificate file, the v5.0.0 installer updates those references to the new installation destination.
This change has no effect on Authentication Proxy releases for Linux.
Here are the details on version 5.0.0:
Primary LDAP authentication with[ad_client]now supports integrated Windows authentication via SSPI using both NTLMv2 and Kerberos with theauth_type=sspioption.Primary LDAP authentication with[ad_client]now supports LDAP Signing plus LDAP Encryption (also known as “Sign and Seal”) for thentlm2andsspiauthentication types when using CLEAR transport.Refer to the Duo Knowledge Base articleDoes the Duo Authentication Proxy support “Sign and Seal”?for additional details.Extends LDAP channel binding support to NTLMv2 authentication.LDAP anonymous bind identification now conforms with LDAP RFC 4513.Now supports LDAP binds usingsamAccountNameand Common NameCNstyle usernames, including forexempt_ouusername to Distinguished NameDNmatch.The connectivity tool issues a warning when the[ad_client]authentication type issspi(Windows integrated) and LDAP account username/password are also provided.Now consistently respects the order of the factors specified via the factors optional setting for[radius_server_auto]and[ldap_server_auto].RADIUS authentication now handles MPPE responses properly per RFC 2548.RADIUSauthenticatorandMessage-Authenticatorverification succeeds when a packet includes multiple non-adjacent attributes of the same type.Fixed an issue where incorrectly encoding attributes in RADIUS packets may have resulted in the Authentication Proxy failing to process further RADIUS packets, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.Logging enhancements.

I’m now trying to get the IKEv2 VPN working but I’m getting failures in the proxy.  It’s configured in exactly the same way as the SSL VPN (indeed the RADIUS settings are shared between the two so you can’t configure them differently) but am getting strange errors.

I’m checking out if Duo is the correct solution for a company I administer.
Successfully I registered my Duo-Admin-User and user A of MacBook A with Duo and the Duo Mobile/Duo Push.Then I enrolled a second user (B) who (mainly) uses MacBook B with DUO, too. And for ease of testing added the same phone for this user B in the admin panel.Additionally I want to protect login to MacBook B with a hardware token. It’s a Yubikey 5 which I also succesfully registered with DUO.
It works ok, but I would like to understand, how & why!
Different from MacBook A this MacBook B never uses Duo Push due to lack of network connection during the early login process. Therefore this user still has “Never authenticated” in his details. Why is this?
I was expecting the user B to show up in the list in Duo Mobile, just like the Admin user and user A. But it’s not. Is that normal? Should/Can I add it manually?
How was MacBook B “informed” that this special Yubikey is the right one?
Sorry for dumb questions, I really tried to find the information somewhere else, to no avail.
Thank you very much!

1416,https://community.duo.com/t/opening-a-feature-request-category-or-maybe-feedback-is-that/7490,Opening a 'feature request' category (or maybe Feedback is that?),Duo Feedback forum,,GwynethLlewelyn,https://community.duo.com/u/GwynethLlewelyn,8/12/2020,"There was a discussion a bit over a year ago, under the General Discussion category, where@Kimberlyasked for aGeneral request for Feature request upvotes. In other ways: a public space where suggestions, feature requests, improvements, future development, etc. could bepubliclydiscussed, between Duo users and the company team.
According to@Amy, the current company policy is the following:
While I have verified that these specific requests have been filed in our internal platform, please share any future feature requests with your Account Executive, Customer Success Manager if applicable, or our Support Team.
Now, many Duo users are (not yet) Duocustomers, even though they use Duo profusely on a daily basis, or have even developed integration with Duo on platforms for third parties (which, in turn,maybe Duo customers, while the developers might not be). It’s obvious that in those cases there aren’t ‘Account Executives’ nor ‘Customer Success Managers’ to contact with ideas; all that remains is contacting the Support Team.
With due respect for the excellent professionals working at Support, I can imagine that they will be easily swamped over sorting through all the proposals and suggestions coming in fromnon-payingusers — which means that they will have to juggle priorities and start addressing issues frompayingcustomers instead. This would be most acceptable in all circumstances; also, when contacting Support, one assumes that there areseriousissues regardingimmediatetechnical support, and any Duo customer (and most non-paying users as well!) would not really wish Support to ‘spend too much time’ with issues not directly related to technical difficulties with the Duo ecosystem/framework.
While I understand that there is aninternaldocumentation management system where all suggestions, feature requests, and so forth are duly archived on that platform, I tend to agree with@Kimberlywhen she says:
Unfortunately, I may be the only such requester for these features and hope that other Duo customers will see value in my requests and submit their own Feature Requests to increase the priority of my own.
In other words: there are possibly a lot ofsimilarissues fromdifferentusers/customers, all of whichmightbe addressed the same way; however, because these are filedseparately, the following occurs:
When contacting support (or any of the other possibilities) with what we think to be anewissue, we have no idea if that issueis already in the queue. This means that Support necessarily will have to go through lots of potential duplicates, andmanuallysort them to forward to the appropriate team that might pick some of those issues for implementation. This takes precious time away from actually being helping customers with technical issues.
Similarly, even if wesuspectthat other people have similar issues, wemightnot report these, simply because, well, someone elsesurelymust have reported it, right? This means that long-standing issues might go unreported just because ‘we all know that this must be being fixed’… when, in fact, wedon’t.
Development teams have a limited time to code, and the decision on what to do will depend on some manager’s ‘intuition’ about how important fixing issue X is. Because Duo is used across so many platforms, technologies, and market segments, such a decision is anything but ‘easy’; all this decision-making manager has to work with is a database with hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of ‘unprocessed’ requests (in the sense that there will be certainly lots of duplicates, unfixable things, things already fixed or planned to do so, requests that are obsolete because the technology changed and made them irrelevant, and so forth), which, however, will have no easy ‘metric’ to aid such decision. The simplest metric (not necessarily thebest, of course) is simply to see a list of features/requests, without duplicates, ordered by the number of ‘votes’ given by the actualusersof the software. While certainly alotof companies donotprioritise their internal development decisions that way, many do so — because the input ofactual usersweighs a lot in theperceptionthat those users have about the software, and, conversely, fixing/adding a feature that is quite popular will, in turn, grow the users’ appreciation of the efforts made by the company to meet their needs.
I understand that Duo is asecuritycompany, and, as such,many‘requests’ or ‘features’ are not really appropriate to be discussedpublicly, because such requestsmayinclude very sensitive data; as a result, I’m not proposing thatconfidentialrequests (and that includes eventual security breaches found, which shouldremainconfidential until a new release is launched that addresses such issues) are made public, but, rather, that the vast majority of innocuous feature requests/suggestions/proposals are handled on apublicforum — and having a Category in the Duo Community forums for that purpose would be excellent!
Similarly, publicly-discussed feature requests/suggestions would allow a certain amount of discussion between users, which might result in several results even before the first line of code is written: proposals may get merged, or amended; users might contribute slight changes to existing proposals, which would go a long way to fix a larger range of issues; really unpopular suggestions — even though they ‘look good on paper’ and might even have been flagged for implementation! — will quickly become apparent during a discussion…
There will be interactions between the development team (or at least a representative for them) and the user base. Typically, this could often ‘prune’ a feature request/suggestion by explaining how such a thing is technologically unfeasible, either in the short time, or perhaps even in the long time. This would allow a proposal — or a series of proposals — to be easily rejected, or archived, and stop wasting anyone’s time…
Here are two concrete examples from my very recent experience:
I’m currently beta-testing an application where there is an internal issue-submission tool allowing these kinds of discussions, as the launch date approaches and developers are swamped over with the code they still have to fix until the application can ‘go public’; over the past 2-3 months, more than 1400 issues have been raised, 800 of which have been either fixed or scheduled for future development — that way, beta-testers know they won’t need to insist on those 800 requests and focus their attention elsewhere; and developers will be happy to know that, when the launch date comes, practically all issues have been either fixed, or reviewed and postponed for future dates, thus allowingthemto switch focus to what needs to be fixed or implementednow; all this, in turn, gets publicly documented as a ‘roadmap’, giving beta-testers an idea ofwhentheir ideas will be implemented. Note that this is neither the first, nor the last application I’ve been beta-testing which uses this approach; and I have to admit that, in the past two decades, I have already seen many different approaches to this model; I personally like some approaches more than others, but I’d say that even the ‘worst’ model is better than, well,nothing.
The other example shows how issues may go unreported for years, simply because we mightassumethat Duo is working on them, and will address them in a forthcoming issue… but we have no ideaifit was reported,whenit was reported, orifit’s scheduled for getting fixed… and this can drag over years!
A few years ago, the WordFence plugin for WordPress (a very popular security tool) incorporated 2FA on their free version (unlike Jetpack’s, which is paid). I have WordFence on automatic upgrade, and a few days after upgrading, I suddenly noticed that I couldn’t log in on those websites that were protected with the Duo WordPress Plugin. The website worked normally; users not protected with Duo’s 2FA could log in without any issue whatsoever; and the logs didn’t report any obvious anomaly. But I, as admin, couldn’t log in. Thus, I had to manually remove all plugins, log back in again, and install them all over again. When Duo was installed, I had to set up 2FA again — making sure that WordFence’s 2FA wasdisabled— and everything worked for that session. A few days later, however, the session cookie expired, and I got a blank page when attempting to log in again. Baffled, I repeated the procedure; and, this time, it was clear that either Duo or WordFence, on their own, would give no problems, but ifbothwere active, it would be impossible to log in. There were no clues on either Duo’s or WordFence’s support areas. Icouldhave raised the issue then, but… surely peoplewouldhave noticed it before me, since, well,at least 20% of all the websites on the  Internet run self-hosted WordPress installationsand the WordFence plugin has been downloadedat least 3 million times, so, someonemusthave noticed this issue too and had already reported it’, I mightnotreport it because it must be ‘obvious’ that it must have been reported… somewhere? But where? It’s not here in the Duo Community forums; it’s not on theWordPress support forum for the Duo WP plugin; neither on theopen issues for the Duo WP plugin on GitHub; however, itismentioned on theWordPress support forum for the WordFence plugin, an issue which was ‘closed’ 2 years and eight months ago… without a solution.
Eventually, as the poster on that WordFence support thread said, when choosing between Duo and WordFence, WordFence is far more important in terms of security, and since italsoprovides 2FA — even if just via OAuth TOTS — I just added it… to my Duo application. So I’m in the strange situation of having dozens and dozens of accounts on the Duo application which I usewithoutthe Duo protocol; while the few cases where Icoulduse the Duo protocol I’m unable to do so because of the conflicts with WordFence!
I’m still waiting for a solution… because I refuse to believe that such an issue hasn’t been reported yet… but the truth is that, well, it has been a few years and I don’t even have a way to knowifthe issue was ever reported, or, if it was,whenis a fix due to be released!
But I didn’t mean to use this Feedback category to surreptitiously file an issue— indeed, this category is meant to be for feedbackaboutthe Duo Communitysite. As such, I’m proposing that Duo adds anewcategory — let’s say ‘Feature requests and suggestions’ or something like that — which applies to feedback on the Duosoftware, andnotthe site itself. Such category would be employed by your support team to actually review and address all issues that aren’tconfidential. There would be some ‘rules’ for adding new topics, such as a pre-defined template illustrating how to submit a feature request, and imposing the rule that ‘likes’ on the first article would count towards ranking it upwards in the list of priorities (always assuming that the support and/or development teams have reviewed such a feature request, considered it worth their time, and approved it for ‘general voting’), as opposed to having people replying in comments with a ‘+1’ or ‘me too!’ (which is always annoying). Evidently, theactualcommitment by Duo to a specific feature wouldnotbe affected on how popular a specific feature request is; the popularity, measured in ‘likes’, would be onlyoneof the metrics used by whoever makes the decisions at Duo about the development roadmap. A very useful metric, as said, but never theonlyone.
This would at least allow users — both paying and non-paying — to get an idea on which issues/suggestions/feature requests had been already proposed (the Discourse engine is not too bad at finding potential duplicates!) and, among those, which have a higher likelihood of being addressed in the future.

I am trying to setup a duo proxy to add 2fa to our rras server.
So I installed the duo proxy on a fresh 2016 server, configured the conf file and setup AD sync. It synced a newley created group just fine. I also enrolled my user.
On the RRAS Server I switched to RADIUS Authentification, added the IP address and the shared secret of the Duo Server.
When I try to connect to the vpn it prompts for username/password. I tried “domain\user” and “password,push”, but no matter what I do, i am just getting a timeout.
So I opened a netstat -a on the Duo server to search for incoming connections, but there is nothing.I tried a telnet to port 1812 on the Duo server but no answer.
Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

For our custom WebSSO, when the embedded browser attempts to render the html page with the iframe, it fails and the sign-up stops. A Microsoft employee wrote
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_integration__sharepoint/2018/02/26/officeword-excel-etc-fails-to-render-duo-multifactor-authentication-login-page/
(which seems to have disappeared from the website very recently, but I have the content appended below.)
In that blog the suggestion was a iframe element like
The difference being that a minimal image is initially inserted into the iframe. We found that this does fix the problem and people can sign-in from those browsers (and it still works on traditional ones).
So, I was wondering what the folks at Duo think of this, and if it appears to be reasonable, be officially documented?

Office(Word, Excel, etc) fails to render DUO multifactor authentication login page
Warren_R_Msft February 26, 2018
Issue:
You have a custom multifactor authentication login pages that leverage DUI API, and all works fine from web browsers but the Office client (Word, Excel, etc) fails to render all of the HTML property, you may see a flicker of the login page but in the end Office shows this error:
“Your organization’s policies are preventing us from completing this action for you.  For more info, please contact your help desk.”
Cause:
When the DUO iframe is loaded from the “duo.form.login.template.html” file, the code is<iframe id=""duo_iframe"" width=""100%"" height=""350px"" frameborder=""0"">Note that the SRC attribute of the Iframe element is missing, causing the iFrame to load the URL about:blank (The Iframe SRC attribute is set at a later point in the Duo-Web-v2.js file).  For security reasons Office does not allow navigation to any non-https end point within the webview which is shown to capture user credentials. The lack of a SRC attribute causes the embedded browser to load “about:blank” in the IFRAME which is not based on HTTPS and Office cannot allow such navigation to take place.
Workaround:
Specifying a SRC attribute for the Iframe element resolves the issue :<iframe id=""duo_iframe"" src=""images/TempImage.gif"" width=""100%"" height=""350px"" frameborder=""0"">(Since we have a SRC, about:blank no longer loads, and hence the issue does not occur)

Thanks for this. I was experiencing this issue with Sharepoint-hosted content protected by CAS + Duo. Users would enter their credentials and submit the CAS login form, then the embedded browser would close and the Office app would show the error above. This happened when opening Word, Excel, PP, and Visio docs as well as when Sharepoint lists were connected to Outlook. Sure enough, the markup for the Duo IFRAME did not contain a src attribute. Once I added one pointing to a blank document, the Duo view started rendering. This is with Office 2013 so the compatibility level of the embedded browser is pretty ancient. The Duo view doesn’t look very nice in it, but it’s functional. Thanks again for the post.",0

I’m a first time DUO user/admin and appreciate any help from the GURU’s. We setup a Windows Server 2016 with RDS role and RD gateway.
So we applied protection on it’s RDP and it has been working. We now plan to protect the RD Gateway. Not sure if I’m doing the right thing though, do i execute the msi for RD Gateway I assume on the same server? but the thing is there’s a different intergration, secret ket and APi key just for RD gateway or I’m doing it wrong??

With the release of Duo Mobile for Android 3.34.0, we recommend that users who sideload the app using theDuo Mobile APKfollow the steps below to uninstall and then reinstall the app.
This will ensure that users will continue to be able to manually update the application in the future in order to continue receiving the latest Duo Mobile functionality and security updates.
Previously, users were able to update the app by installing a new APK over an installed older version, preserving existing settings. Due to an upgrade in the APK signing key for version 3.34.0, they will need to uninstall the older APK and then reinstall the new one.

Before following the steps below to uninstall and then reinstall the app, users should be aware that their Duo-protected accounts will be deleted byuninstalling the app.Any backups created by usingDuo Restorewill also be deleted when the app is uninstalled. Users will need toadd their accountsback to Duo as if they were a new Duo user.
We strongly recommend that users who rely on Duo to protectthird-party accountssuch as Facebook or Instagram remove Duo as their authenticator from those accounts before uninstalling the app in orderto avoid getting locked outof those accounts.
Instructions: How to perform the app reinstallation
Before beginning, review the information above about the impact of uninstalling the app on your Duo-protected accounts.
The following steps explain how to uninstall and then reinstall the app for users who sideload:
To uninstall the existing Duo Mobile for Android app:a. Swipe up from the bottom to open the Apps drawer.b. Press and hold down theDuo Mobileicon.c. SelectApp info, thenUninstall. Confirm by tappingOK.

Troubleshooting tips
Please note these instructions may vary based on the type of phone and operating system. In all cases, it is important to actuallyuninstallDuo Mobile andnot simply remove the app’s shortcut iconfrom the phone’s home screen.
Future updates
If users choose not to update Duo Mobile for Android in this way, they will still be able to authenticate normally. However, we always recommend updating to the latest version of Duo software.
Once users update Duo Mobile for Android to version 3.34.0, they will be able to update in the future by using the established method of installing a new APK on top of an existing installation.

Ruckus is the last piece of network gear that I was trying to get on RADIUS auth with MFA, so I was hoping to see if anyone has accomplished this before I open up some support cases.  In my testing, the Duo Push comes through and returns a success to Ruckus, and Ruckus denies the login.  Ruckus support was never helpful.
Thanks.Jason",1

The DAG Admin page just gives us the old “page cannot be displayed” when hitting localhost/dag or fqdn/dag. When we uninstall the DAG from the server, we are able to reach the default IIS serving site. We resort to building a new server every time after backup the config.",1

That being said I followed the implementation by one of the other users here, John1, and it is working like a charm - except for service accounts.

This only happens when the account is used from the application itself (specifically netbackup and veeam)  If the account is used to log in directly to vsphere it works fine.
Anyone run into this problem before or have any thoughts?
It was implemented using active directory over ldap, service name as DN, and normal ldap. (not ldaps)  OpenLDAP did not seem to work even though I could get it to save as an identity source.

1542,https://community.duo.com/t/duo-on-rd-gateway-causing-timeout-after-8-hours-what-should-we-do/6401,Duo on RD Gateway causing timeout after 8 hours. What should we do?,Protecting Applications forum,,SVMax,https://community.duo.com/u/SVMax,3/2/2020,"Hello,
We have a Remote Desktop Session (RDS) collection with all of our servers running Windows Server 2016.
We currently have Duo installed on our RD Web Access so that our users get prompted with Duo when they login to the web portal. This is not enough security for us. The web portal downloads .RDP files that log into our session hosts. A user could easily save an .RDP on their computer to log into for next time (or worse, an attacker obtains it) so that they bypass the web portal. Because of this, we either have to have Duo on our RD Gateway or RD Session hosts to prevent the web portal bypass.
We have been trying out Duo on our RD Gateway but have come across into aHUGEissue. Our users are being disconnected after 8 hours, no matter if they’re active or idle. It seems like several customers of Duo have been experiencing this issue but the issuehas not been resolved since October 2018. Link here:Duo RD Gateway CAP/RAP Session timeout settings.
A potential workaround is to install Duo right on our session hosts. While this would work, it’s extremely frustrating for our users to have to use Duo every time they open an application. RDS gives us the capability to publish apps into a “Work Resources” folder on the users start menu. When they click the app, it logs them into the server and opens the app. But when we install Duo on the session host, it asks them to authenticateevery time. Since this is not a web-based application, we cannot use the “remembered devices” feature. We also cannot use the “authorized networks” feature because all connections are being made come from the RD web access/gateway, thus appearing from an internal IP.
Both of these options greatly affect our users and we don’t want to have to choose our poison. Does any one have any suggestions on how to implement Duo in an RDS environment that’s not invasive to users?
If the Duo on RD Gateway bug was fixed, all of this would be a non-issue.",0

Today, we updated the GPG key used to signDuo Unixdistribution packages to improve the strength and security of our package signatures. If you are currently using this application, the next time that you upgrade the Duo Unix package via yum, apt, or apt-get, you will also have to update the key.
Depending on which distribution of Unix you are using, you will need to run the following command during the application upgrade process to update the GPG key.

These are the same commands that must be run to import Duo’s GPG signing keys for a new installation of Duo Unix. If you are running Duo Unix on CentOS5, RHEL 5, Debian 6, or Debian 7, you do not need to update your GPG key as these distributions are no longer supported by Duo and the latest version of Duo Unix available on these distributions are signed using the deprecated GPG key.

Why?,Unix and SSH,authentication-proxy | linux-ldap,dee,https://community.duo.com/u/dee,4/17/2020,"My Duo Auth proxy appears to be failing all of my ssh logins after a 10 second interval. The timeout starts when the (console) user hits [ENTER] on their password, to the time they hit accept on the duo push.  I’ve increased all timeouts I can find on my auth chain to 60 seconds but the 10 second fail still persists.
the[ad_client]stanza in my authproxy.cfg contains a timeout of 60 but the default is 10. I’m wondering if something is messed up here because this is the only 10 second timeout I can find anywhere.
Right when the ssh server logspam_ldap: ldap_result Timed outin syslog, this message is logged in the auth proxy’s authproxy.log file:Received extraneous LDAP PDU while resolving a BindRequest: LDAPMessage(id=5, value=LDAPBindRequest(version=3, dn=’’, auth=’**’, sasl=False), controls=None)
If I drop the user into bypass mode in the Duo admin panel, the problem isn’t there but not sure that means anything since there is no incorporated token or lock-screen delay after entering a password.
I can simulate a network “outage” to test the ssh server timeout by firewalling the connection to the auth proxy on the OUTPUT chain right before the password is entered. After 60 seconds of waiting around, syslog notes a failed auth attempt. This seems to suggest the 10 second issue is still upstream (auth proxy or LDAP servers).
Can someone offer some insight as to what might be going on here? Is the timeout in authproxy.cfg being ignored somehow and defaults being used?",1

Been battling this API for 2 weeks now.  We’re finally pulling data – our department head wants reporting on authentications, but doesn’t care for the UI, so I’ve been tasked with developing a data-pull from the/admin/v2/logs/authenticationendpoint.  I got it to pull the last 24 hours, and we’re able to insert it all into a custom DB on or side to source the reporting.  Shiny.
Next request: can you pull everything from this year?  Sure… shouldn’t be too hard.   Except I’m getting a429 -Too Many Requestswithin the first couple pulls (limit 1000, mintime and maxtime set 12 hours apart.)  I started sleeping the program for various intervals, and I’m finding that if I set the interval for any less than 30 seconds, I start getting 429’s.  One run – set at 20 seconds – failed after the third request.  3 requests in 40 seconds, and it died.
This is insane.  I’m the only one using this ikey/skey.  We use Duo for MFA across the company (about 900-950 authentications per business day since the COVID shutdown, maybe 100-200 daily before that).  But in terms of the API, I’m it.  Just me and my Visual Studio.  But it’s been too much, apparently, for the API to handle, so I’ve been crawling along, pulling 45 days worth of data over the last 90 minutes.
Is this application of the API somehow unexpected?  How could I possibly be taxing the server at this rate?",1

As said induoweb guide, it is not advisable to use Auth APIs other than /ping and /check for Duo web.
But when I tried Auth API’s /preauth with Web SDK’s authorization keys, it is working fine even though it is said in guide as “Incorporating any other Auth API endpoint calls in your Duo Web application may have unpredictable results.”
I would be glad if I get clarified for the following,
Since the /preauth endpoint is working fine with WebSDK’s integration and security keys, is it okay to use it ?
Is there any other way to validate the Auth API’s integration/security keys since Auth API’s /check endpoint works the same for both WebSDK and AuthAPI ?
Thank you in advance.",0

Improvements toDirectory Syncfor users with invalid email addresses, addition of ability to edit non-synced notes or alias fields
During a directory sync, if a user has an invalid email address, their remaining user data will still be synced. Previously in cases like this, the user would not have been synced. For Active Directory and OpenLDAP syncs, invalid distinguished names (DN) will also now be ignored.If notes or alias fields are not synced from a directory, those fields can now be edited via the Duo Admin Panel or theAdmin API. Previously, this feature was only available for Azure Active Directory syncs. It is now available for Active Directory and OpenLDAP, as well.Links todocumentationwill now appear on Directory Sync pages in the Admin Panel.

Master Enrollment and User Management in the Admin Panel,Duo Level Up forum,,Tab_Berger,https://community.duo.com/u/Tab_Berger,4/30/2020,"I’m pleased to announce that we have two new Admin Panel Essentials courses open for registration -Enrollment Methods & StrategiesandEnd-User Account Management! These two courses explore user administration through the entire end-user lifecycle, from associating them with their first 2FA device, to removing them from the Admin Panel when they leave the company. New administrators planning a deployment will find many tips to help their Duo rollout be more successful, and experienced administrators can evaluate different approaches to better integrate Duo with their existing processes and infrastructure.
Enrollment Methods & Strategies
This course is a deep dive into enrollment, the process of adding new end-users to the Duo Admin Panel and associating them with a 2FA device. We’ll break down all the available enrollment methods, policies, and share best practices to teach your end-users what Duo is, how Duo will impact them, and how to get enrolled. Here’s a little taste of the Enrollment Methods breakdown section below! Beta participants can register for the coursehere
1286×938 209 KB
End-User Account Management
This course focuses on end-users that are already in the Admin Panel in either a partially and fully enrolled state. You’ll explore user and device management considerations post-deployment, including tips for conserving licenses, configuration options, and Admin Panel features to optimize management of your existing user population. My favorite part about this course is the comprehensive section dedicated to managing partial enrollment! Beta participants can registerhere.

I’m trying to use DUO for second-factor authentication for an application.The application has a built-in RADIUS client. We are using the RADIUS client to handshake with an on-premise DUO Authentication Proxy, but using the “DUO_Only_Client” configuration since the application already provides primary authentication.
The setup works fine, however instead of receiving a push notification from DUO, the application is prompting for a RADIUS passcode. My device is enrolled for push notifications, and I know it works since I use push notification to authenticate to the DUO admin console and also a separate VPN client. Is it possible I’m not receiving a push notification because the setup is using the “DUO_Only_Client” settings and requires a passcode for the DUO Auth Proxy to verify the user?
Your help is appreciated…

I’m just deploying a DUO solution for one of my customers, install was fine and now I have a issue that I’m trying to setup.
Using a Fortigate:
customer has setup sslvpn using a tunnel - everything works fine DUO send the push to the client and connection is established
Customer setting up a Web Portail - using duo - the same user on the original DUO group does not get to the portal but to the regular default one.

We are getting an ever growing number of complaints that when RDP users fail to respond to their Duo token on their mobile within the 60 second timeout (most get distracted and forget to authenticate), their system will not allow them to initiate a second token.I know from my own experience (and just tested it), that if I do not respond I can simply just click “Send me a push” to get a second token, but from the complaints, users state they get no option for the second push and for Mac users, they must reboot their Mac to re-initiate anther RDP session.Has anyone seen this before and/or any way to mitigate?

The traffic flow:
SSL VPN users connect to Gateway (Checkpoint) > Primary authentication using locally created users > Secondary authentication Radius server pointed to Duo.
Is this the correct way of doing?  If yes, how will the user/pwd entered by a client as a part of primary authentication be known to Duo and how will it verify against that username in the Duo Security cloud?

The auth proxies have been working well for about a year or so.
Over the weekend, I thought I’d try using the auth proxies as the source for SSH authentication. This was simple enough: change toPasswordAuthentication yesinsshd_configand then replace the on-prem ldap servers in/etc/ldap.confwith the IPs of the Duo auth proxies.

We’re excited to announce thatDuo Single Sign-On is now open for public betato U.S.-based, non-Federal customers. The beta is being rolled out following our standard phased deployment process, which means that it will become available in your Duo Admin Panel between March 16 and March 27, 2020.
You are encouraged to join andshare your feedback with us! Please read on for more details.
Duo Single Sign-On is a cloud-hosted SAML Identity Provider (IdP) that adds two-factor authentication, complete with inline self-enrollment and the Duo Prompt, to popular cloud services like Salesforce and Amazon Web Services using SAML 2.0 federation.
By allowing users to access multiple applications with a single username and password, Duo Single Sign-On helps mitigate the risk of bad password habits while making it easier to work flexibly. You can even create access policies that can differ by application, depending on the sensitivity of its data and the privileges of the user, which reduces user friction while protecting your most important assets.
Duo Single-Sign On is available to U.S.-based, non-Federal deployments. It will be included at no additional cost in our MFA, Access, and Beyond editions.
Look for the “Single Sign-On” page under “Applications” in your Duo Admin Panel. You can learn more about Duo Single Sign-On by visiting ourdocumentation.

I access it via a Windows 10 laptop. Would love your help in solving an issue!
For the past few months, I’ve found that Duo works great until I restart my PC (that has Duo installed).  After a restart, I’m able to RDP into the machine like normal, but instead of seeing the Duo screen (where you need to do push verification/text/call) I get stuck at the Windows login screen. I input the (correct) username and password, and get the error “Timeout or other network error”.
Logging into Duo Admin online, I don’t see these login attempts listed.
Sometimes I’m able to fix it by removing and reinserting the ethernet cable.  Other times, I’ll need to hook up a monitor/mouse/keyboard to it, and log in directly. Huge pain.
My hunch is that when the PC restarts, it isn’t able to access the internet (and Duo) until someone logs in locally.  But I have not been able to troubleshoot it from there.

Im currently struggling to get the Auth Proxy working at all.
We have it configured to talk to AD and it can bind fine.I run the test tool and the error that comes up is that the “Auth proxy did not get results searching for users in the DN”
The DN is 100% correct and ive tried multiple other ones i know works on other systems.The group has users in it like any other group.
A wireshark shows the Ldap query working fine, but no results.
What on earth is going on. Am i missing something critical here?
The configuration is identical of whats described onDuo SecurityPalo Alto GlobalProtectDuo integrates with your Palo Alto GlobalProtect Gateway via RADIUS to add two-factor authentication to VPN logins.

So far, I have to say, my experience had not been a pleasant one.
My major pain point has to do with fingerprint recognition. Look, maybe I missed the configuration somewhere, maybe I’m just dumb I can’t figure it out, but HAVE YOU GUYS NOT HAD ANY CONSIDERATION FOR IN-SCREEN FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION!!!
I get a request to approve the login, I click on the approve button with fingerprint icon, and I’m led to a screen asking for password. !!! What happened to the fingerprint? I tried so many times to trigger it to allow me to do that until I saw my colleagues just put his finger on the fingerprint sensor. Oh duh! Right, for phones with additional fingerprint sensor that works, but where should I put my finger on to trigger that authentication?
Sorry I sound so exasperated, but that’s how I feel right now. Can you image what it feel like when you are asked to authenticate multiple times a day, and have to type in really complicated password twice every time? Our company requires really long and complicated password to authenticate, and for my personal security, I put relatively complicated passcode (which is fine when I only need to type it them every a few days). But putting those 2 together, it is just a mess!

As part of an upcoming Duo release, we are adding a short message at the top of the emails that get sent to end-users duringenrollment in DuoorDuo Mobile activation.
Here’s a preview of what this will look like:
Enrollment Email Message
email_text_11174×940 150 KB
The message reads:
This is an automated email from Duo Security.
Your organization invites you to set up a user account for Duo. You will find instructions from your Duo administrator below. If you have questions, please reach out to your organization’s IT or help desk team.
Activation Email Message
email_text_2652×883 146 KB
The message reads:
This is an automated email from Duo Security.
Your organization invites you to set up Duo Mobile on your phone. You will find instructions from your Duo administrator below. If you have questions, please reach out to your organization’s IT or help desk team.
These messages will not be editable because they’re designed to be a consistent point of reference for end-users to judge whether an email they’ve received is a phishing attempt.
While these new messages will not be editable, thebody of the emailwill continue to be customizable for administrators on paid editions of Duo, just like it is today. Note that we do not allowcustomization using HTMLfor security reasons.
If you have any documentation for your end-users or your help desk that includes screenshots of enrollment or activation emails, it’s a good idea to update those to reflect the addition of these messages. That will help people know to expect a change in the wording of Duo enrollment and activation emails.
Please let us know if you have any questions!",1

We are testing the trial version, because we would like to implement 2fa authentication for Windows remote desktop connections.
We went through all the steps in the documentation, registered a test user, activated a phone number, which also shows up on the dashboard.
We installed the program with the keys as an administrator, which succeeded with no errors.
Our problem is that when the test user logs in (our users only log in via remote desktop connection) the DUO login screen does not show up, nothing changes.
Any idea?

Improvements and enhanced troubleshooting support forDirectory Syncwhen using Active Directory (AD) or OpenLDAP
If an administrator has configured two or more domain controllers or domain servers, the Directory Sync service will try each one in order when attempting to perform a successful sync. Previously, domain controllers or domain servers were tried at random.A new section of help text has been added to the configuration pages for Active Directory or OpenLDAP syncs called “Troubleshooting.” It includes tips on identifying and fixing common issues.From the new Troubleshooting section, administrators now can also run a diagnostic sync. To assist with diagnosing any issues, the Administrator Actions report will now also display a 32-character Sync Reference Code that can be provided to the Duo Support Team when seeking help. The Administrator Actions report is viewable in the Reports section of the Admin Panel.Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (AD LDS) proxied users are now supported for AD syncs.Performance for AD and OpenLDAP syncs has been improved across the board.Synced groups will be named differently to prevent name collisions and unexpected changes in users’ group membership and group-related security posture. Groups that are associated with a Directory Sync will now include the name of that Directory Sync. This will appear in the Admin Panel as shown below:dir_sync_group_names1776×1086 214 KB

Admin Panel fixes:When searching for groups, applications, users, or devices in the search bar at the top of the Admin Panel, clicking “View more” will now apply that search query to the list an admin is redirected to. Previously, the query was passed through to the URL string of the list page but was not actually run to filter the results.If an Admin Panel session has timed out or the logged-in account changes, an error message of “Unable to parse response as JSON” will no longer be displayed for certain account actions to avoid confusing administrators.Directory Sync fixes:If an Azure Active Directory Sync is configured to send enrollment emails, syncs of a single user will send an enrollment email only to that user. This change should improve the performance of username syncs.

We have been using Duo for Windows for a while. We have two Mac devices that also have Duo but we don’t like that it doesn’t ask for 2FA on lock screen. Users prefer to lock their devices over shutting them down, when stepping away or even at the end of the day.
This would be a useful feature and while we are on that topic, is there any update for supporting offline 2FA on Mac?",0

New features, enhancements, and other improvements
Enhancements toDirectory Sync
Admins who do not have permissions to configure Directory Synchronization will no longer be able to see the Authentication Proxy entry in the sub-navigation.Duplicate attributes are no longer allowed across username and alias fields for synchronized Active Directory and OpenLDAP directories. For example, you cannot have “samaccountname” as the attribute for both username and alias 1.Sub-navigation links for Active Directory, Azure Active Directory and OpenLDAP pages will now be hidden on small screens to enable administrators to see more of the main content.Invalid groups in an Azure Active Directory will no longer prevent the directory configuration page from saving. For example, if a group that has been added to Duo via Azure is deleted in Azure, admins will still be able to save the directory settings in the Admin Panel.Added additional instructions for configuring the Authentication Proxy using NTLM or plain authentication in both the Admin Panel UI and in the preconfigured file download provided to admins.auth_proxy_instructions1776×1508 239 KB

I’m very new to Duo. I’m looking for a second factor for RDP sessions.
So I just created my first Duo Account with my e-mail address and my phone number. Now I can login to the admin panel - getting the 6-digit code on my phone within the Duo-App.
First I created a user (manualy) just by giving a name (the same name as the RDP-user). After this I added a Phone to this new user. The given phone is my own phone… the same phone that I use for the admin account.
In the last step I added an RDP application. Now I have “Microsoft RDP” with keys and hostname. I downloaded the software, installed it on my Windows Server 2019 and did the first try.
With my RDP-Login there comes up the new Duo-Screen. I was asked for the code. So far so good.Unfortunately, the code from my phone didn’t work. I guess it’s because I’m the admin and a user at the same time?Because several 6-digit codes from the Duo-App didn’t work I requested a code via SMS. A few moments later my phone recieved the SMS and the given code worked fine. I was able to login to my RDP-Server.
So the SMS on my own phone worked but the code inside the Duo-App on the same phone didn’t.
What do I have to change?
In my Duo-App I have only 1 account. This account is a “Duo Admin”… but it has the username of my manualy added user. I guess this is the issue.

We’re not 100% clear on the advantages of using CHAP in a Duo environment.According to the documentationthe credentials between the VPN client and RRAS server are always PAP, which is ok because they’re passed through a previously encrypted tunnel (eg. L2TP).
However, what isn’t made clear is how these credentials are then passed from RRAS to the Duo Proxy. If it’s PAP, does the request from RRAS to the Duo Proxy send the credentials in cleartext?This KB articlestates:
The user credentials are then passed through this encrypted channel to the VPN, and on to the Duo Authentication Proxy using PAP, with the specified shared key used to encrypt the password, on your internal network.
This does not make much sense, it seems to be suggesting that the VPN shared key is passed to Duo, along with the encrypted payload containing the password?

We are trying to get auth, admin, and telephony logs to our SIEM (LogRhythm) prior to go-live. Since there is no connector/plugin for Duo that leaves the method of pulling the logs down via API and ingesting them as a flat file or csv format. I am aware of these resources for accomplishing this:https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logsandhttps://github.com/duosecurity. However, the team that operates our SIEM does not have a strong scripting background and this process will live on their platform. Are there more resources I am missing that could help them get this going?
The fact that Duo does not provide a more seamless process, or does not put more effort into working with SIEM vendors to make it seamless, IMO is a major drawback of the product. Any corporation with any compliance or regulatory restrictions will need to have these logs ingested into a SIEM. This should not be a manual, custom process that is prone to human error.",1

Two-Factor Authentication for F5 BIG-IP APM with RADIUS and Duo Prompt
Learn how Duo integrates with your F5 BIG-IP APM to add two-factor authentication to any VPN login, complete with inline self-sevice enrollment and Duo Prompt.
However, we have a DUO auth issue logging in with the browser and also with the View client.
With the browser the DUO auth step completes (session log shows that step is a success), but the[Common/HorizonView_VDI.app/HorizonView_VDI_remote_desktop] fails to connect.

Clicking on it gets another login window which shows the apps after username, password and domain are entered.
On the thick client, after the username, password and domain are entered, a popup window asking for “Next Code” appears.
After entering a “1” there (usually this means “send me a DUO push” from what I understand), and error comes back saying, “A RADIUS challenge failure occurred.”
Has anyone seen this behavior before? Any idea what’s causing it? I’m doing the same thing to add DUO for our F5 VPN and it works fine.

This appears not to be the case.  OWA goes through the Duo authentication process but using the full Outlook client, which was previously setup, there is not Duo requirement.
Is this because Outlook was previously setup?  (O365 Outlook, current version)

1715,https://community.duo.com/t/customizations-alternatives-for-openldap-sync-for-other-ldap-implementations/6179,Customizations & alternatives for OpenLDAP sync for other LDAP implementations,Directory Sync,ldap | openldap,ray.walker,https://community.duo.com/u/ray.walker,1/29/2020,"Our institution does not run OpenLDAP as it’s primary directory, nor is AD a primary user directory. (Currently on UnboundID/Ping)
This provides difficulty for implementing a user/group synch for Duo.
I’m curious as to how some Duo Community members are overcoming this issue, as the FAQ (Synchronizing Users from OpenLDAP | Duo Security) states: “LDAP variants other than OpenLDAP may require additional configuration or modules to provide the necessary attributes to Duo.” How is this done?
I was also wondering if it would be beneficial/possible to allow for more/better customization for the configuration of the existing OpenLDAP Synch.
Here’s my current idea:Some LDAP implementations use a variation of the ‘groupOfNames’ objectclass for their groups. Some use groupOfUniqueNames, etc. but any ‘sane’ mechanism would still use a DN reference for their members.Customization of the following would provide to be useful:objectclass: groupOfNamesmember attribute: member (dn)name attribute: cnentrydn (why not use dn?) & entryuuid (wouldn’t this be redundant if you already have a dn?)a reverse (user based membership) lookup customization. For example, we employ a cn based ‘memberof’ Not that sane, but still unique, as it’s part of the group DN.
Other than that, I’m all ears on suggestions for user/group synch mechanisms for non OpenLDAP directories.",0

Admin Panel fixes
The Username, Alias, Full Name, First Name, and Last Name input fields on an individual User page are now extended and are the same length as the Email field to avoid inputted text from “disappearing” past the text box.On an individual user page, synced alias fields are now visible on page load, even if they are blank.When adding a Duo Administrator, clarified the “Missing number” error to state “Missing phone number” when a phone number is not entered.On the Settings page, in the Bypass codes section, changed the wording “Help Desk admins” to “admins with the Help Desk role” to add certainty about the scope of this setting.Authorizing an Azure CA application on a child account will no longer cause an error to appear.The self-service portal toggle on an application’s properties page now displays the correct value to Duo Administrators who have read-only permissions for applications (User Manager, Help Desk, Billing, Read-only). Previously, it would always display Enabled in its read-only view despite the actual value.The tables on each tab (Azure Active Directory, Active Directory, and OpenLDAP) on the Directory Sync page are now sorted alphabetically without case sensitivity (e.g. dasd, nd-test, OpenLDAP) as opposed to being sorted case-sensitively. This now matches other tables throughout the Admin Panel.On Azure Directory Sync pages, Duo Administrators who are restricted by administrative units now have a read-only view of the group select box. They previously could update groups but didn’t have the ability to save them.

I’m having a little trouble understanding authorized networks and using the microsoft rdp application.
Looking at this pagehttps://help.duo.com/s/article/2155?language=en_USit says Windows Logon (RDP sessions only) is supported, I’m assuming that is the microsoft rdp application.
Now I have the login client installed on the rdp server and that all works fine. What I do notice is in the auth logs on the admin site it reports the internal IP of the server when a user rdp’s and duo auths to the server.
Over to the authorized networks policy part.If I add the external ip of the client connecting to the rdp server, it doesn’t seem to do anything (still pops up for duo).If I add the internal ip of the rdp SERVER for testing it stops asking for duo for everyone since it always will be the server ip not the client so not all that useful. (I know it says to only use external ip’s for the authorized networks so im guessing this is not the way).
Am I missing something here?
Thanks folks,Craig",1

We currently have a sub-account for our EPCS-mandated users at our organization. Our setup is two different domains that have users that will need MFA for EPCS activation. The second domain users AD security group contains the users that appear to be experiencing the following reported issue.
A handful of these users in the second AD domain are receiving multiple enrollment emails directing them to enroll a device into EPCS. One user in particular has received  multiple emails since their initial inclusion on19 Dec 19. Since then, they have received additional enrollment emails on20 Dec 19, 28 Dec 19, 18 Jan 20, and 20 Jan 20.
I’ve noticed that there have been some changes to the format of the Admin Portal. Might there be some sort of change regarding the time-frame where enrollment emails are sent out to unenrolled users as well? Last I recalled the time-frame was these emails were defaulting to being sent every 30 days.

I am a DUO security administrator and want to use my smartphone with “DUO PUSH” function both for login to the DUO admin panel AND for login to windows.
But I made some tests and found out that the “DUO PUSH”-function only works for ONE method, either login to DUO admin panel or login to windows. It seems that the barcode can only be scaned ONE time and so the Push-access is only possible for one method at the time.
Renaming the administrator in the DUO admin-panel does not help, because the administrator is not counted as “USER” for windows-login.
SMS-code works fine for both methods together at the same time, but unfortunately not DUO-PUSH.
Is there a solution?
By the way: I use the FREE-Edition. Maybe this is a restriction?

I had a read of this but unfortunately my issue is different:
So, I have 2 servers.
One is an AD/ADFS/LDAP Server, and another is the DUO Proxy server. DUO is working via ADFS SSO but now I am moving on to setting it up for LDAP for the Solarwinds dashboard.
I have set everything up down to a tee following DUOs guide, added the ldap_server_auto, set up all keys, api etc. I set up a duoservices account (read-only and no admin rights) for duo to use.
The proxy server connects fine and I am not seeing any issues between the proxy and the main DC server.
Internally, 389/636 both connect, 443 is allowed on both server in bound and outbound, 636 is allowed through the firewall which I can see it being allowed. Windows firewall is activated, so I added 636 as an inbound port to this, but I cannot telnet over to the server still from my own PC on port 389 or 636, which is strange.
While Solarwinds nable dashboard uses port 443, I was told to open inbound 636 which is, on the firewall its coming in, the logs are showing me hitting the server on both ports. I have also disabled Windows FW and still can’t telnet.
This is what I have of DUO support:
So, the app would need to be able to reach the authentication proxy through your firewall to port 636 - Done this. Nothings listening on 636 so its possibly why I can’t telnet? Do I need to purchase SSLs for this, or would Lets Encrypt work or better yet, does duo proxy installer not bring SSLs with it?
The authentication proxy will need to communicate on either port 389/636 to your AD server depending on whether ldap/ldaps is used on your internal network. - This works fine.
The authentication proxy will need to be able to communicate outbound via port 443 to the Duo API. - This works fine.
Once this is set up, because the dashboard utilities LDAP and is pointing directly to the DC server, would I need to change it so it points to the proxy server so it authenticates against DUO?
I thought I would ask here instead of going back to support as someone here may have a better understanding of connecting it all so I can use duo to authenticate in to the solarwinds dashboard.
Sorry for my all my questions, still learning duo and just want to get good at it
Cheers,
James",1

Will DUO only ask the user to “authenticate themsleves” the once say when the account is added to the device and no longer request the user to authenticate?
Will DUO ask the user to “authenticate themsleves”  each time the mobile device exchanges email (sent or recveived)?
Will DUO treat the mobile device differently and ask the users to “authenticate themsleves”  at certain times/events?4 or just how will DUO handle these devices?

The problem with this is when the windows popup is up users can not check the “remember me for X hours” checkbox. Also if users cancel the windows security popup it kills the duo flow and need to refresh the page.
This is causing a lot of frustrations for our users as most of them do not have a work provided cell phone and do not want to use their personal one so their only method of MFA is the security key. Does anyone know of a way to disable the windows security popup and let chrome handle the key?",0

We’ve completed some testing today and it does not appear that password changes are working when connecting to RRAS remotely via Duo 2FA mobile app. Two scenarios tested were
When a domain password expires
When an admin selects “user must change password at next logon”
When not using Duo you get prompted via the native windows client to change your password.  When using / requiring 2FA you simply don’t get connected and you don’t get prompted / notified about an issue with your password.
Please advise on how to get this working as this client changes passwords for remote users quite often and if this feature is not available it will impact their workflow considerably.",1

Recently 2 of our users are experiencing slow authentication prompt after changing their domain password. It’s now taking 25-30 seconds before the Duo authentication prompt appears after they enter their domain password.  I sent the logs to support and they can’t figure it out also. Their support suck.
We uninstalled Duo, logged in with no issues. Re-installed Duo, logged in and the 25-30 sec delay persists. Had another user log in to the same machine and the same result. Blew out the user’s Duo account, uninstalled Duo from Windows, uninstalled Duo Mobile app, deleted all register/files/folder that is related to Duo. Then re-create the user’s Duo account, re-installed the application, rerolled the user, and the damn delay persists.
We almost gave up, but we tried one last thing which had a positive result. We had the user change his domain password back to his current one, and the delay went away. I am confused now… I’m not sure what could be causing the issue. Has anyone experienced this before?
Any help would be much appreciated.

I love the app, but really wish it provides a mechanism to organize all these accounts into sections or folders for easier lookup and access, as the current layout works well for up to a dozen or so accounts, but not when there are many more.
Obviously for native DUO-push enabled applications this is not a problem as we don’t have to search for the accounts from within the app. But as mentioned, there are still many third-party sites out there using the old school TOTP which is unlikely to go away anytime soon. For these accounts we do have to go through the list to find the corresponding codes from the app.
So first a search bar at the very top of the app, between the DUO logo and the + sign, would be an easy start.
Then it would be great to have some form of organizers, either in the form of collapsible sections or folders (such as the layout of an Android smartphone home screen). Maybe add a “default” or “favorite” section that expands by default upon app launch too for convenient access to frequently accessed accounts.
Hopefully this request may be submitted to DUO developers for consideration.",0

When the power came back on, what would happen is this:  We’d try connecting to the Cisco ASA’s (5508-X).  When prompted to enter username/password/2nd password, we enter the correct credentials, but the login prompt just cycles back to empty username/password/2nd password fields, over and over again.
We rebuilt the connection profile based off of these directions (Cisco ASA SSL VPN for Browser and AnyConnect | Duo Security).  We even get to the point of testing the setup as instructed under Add the Duo LDAP Server.  Sure enough, we get a push notification and the test passes.  But to get the actual login to work keeps doing the same thing over and over again.
I’ve checked the AD server’s Security log, in case there was, in fact, a login error.  The security audit log shows nothing but a successful authentication via the AnyConnect app to Active Directory.
The syslog on the ASA device shows the device completes the SSL handshake for a TLS v1.2 session…then immediately disconnects with zero explanation why.
I’m stumped.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

An AD security group was created and added to Duo to allow certain user accounts to bypass Duo 2FA when logging in to their VDI.  This part is working correctly.

The autologin credentials are specified via a VMware goup policy snap in on the Thin Client hosting the Horizon Client/VDI.  After enabling 2FA none of those shared accounts will autologin.  The settings are still present and the username is populated in the Horizon Client but not the password. This broke immediately after enabling Duo 2FA.

The Duo Mobile app for iOS will soon support Dark Mode. This feature will be available beginning with Duo Mobile for iOS version 3.30.0. The release of version 3.30.0 of the app will coincide with Apple’s release of iOS 13 this fall. This functionality will only be compatible with iOS 13 and newer.
This long-awaited functionality is intended to make the app easier to use in low-light conditions and for users with sensitive eyesight. It can also help save battery life by illuminating fewer pixels.
Here are some screenshots of the app in Dark Mode:
dark.png1000×1063 141 KB
Users with devices running iOS 13 and newer can enable Dark Mode through two different ways:
Navigate to Settings App > Display & Brightness and select the “Dark” appearance.Navigate to Control Center, long press the brightness slider, and tap the “Dark Mode” icon.
Navigate to Settings App > Display & Brightness and select the “Dark” appearance.
Navigate to Control Center, long press the brightness slider, and tap the “Dark Mode” icon.
Also included in version 3.30.0 of Duo Mobile for iOS are some slight aesthetic tweaks to the general appearance of the app outside of Dark Mode. The color of buttons and backgrounds throughout the app have been consolidated, along with the color and size of text elements. Here is an example of the “tweaked” look in the “light” or regular mode:

I was wondering if somebody can assist with where I am going wrong, because the guide to setup either pam_duo or login_duo seem to lack in proper instructions and don’t give good enough details for new comers to duo.
I followed pam_duo to a tee. Every thing setup correctly (443 is open outbound and inbound to all traffic and so is 80), I set up all the keys etc. so I then logged out of SSH to then try jump on PuTTy and log back in expecting it to make me authenticate with duo and duo didn’t work at all. This is a local root user I was trying it with as its just a test box for now just so I can get a proof of concept to work, or attempt to.
So, I tried it with login_duo next, every going fine, did the test “/usr/sbin/login_duo” which worked to an extent, gave me the link to enroll which was good, I thought everything was going fine. Until again, jumped off PuTTy, SSHd back in and still no DUO authenticator…
If I do “ssh root@cockpit.local” it then asks me to authenticate through DUO and sends me codes or push to authenticate to my duo app, but doing it through PuTTy doesn’t.
Don’t ask me to do login -d either, because that just repeats what the “ssh root@cockpit.local” does and asks me to authenticate with duo.
So, ofcourse I am going wrong somewhere, but where?
I use a VPN to jump on to the network the Linux box is on, but thats about it.
Any assistance would be appreciated.

(It also must know it is SHA1 and how many digits, etc…) It must be standard because Duo can import third-party tokens knowing only the serial number and the security key.
That said, I can’t seem to get the single (non-Duo) app I use for all other MFA to have the correct passcode for Duo.  I’ve tried both the TOTP and HOTP version.  I know that the key is case sensitive, (although I was surprised/disappointed that Duo limited it to hex characters), but adjusting the case hasn’t worked either.
Does anyone know if the algorithm folds in the serial number too?  I entered a (made-up) serial number into Duo when importing the token, but I thought that was just for identification purposes.  I don’t include that in the key entered into the app.
Just for reference, I’m currently testing against OTP Auth (by Roland Moers) on the iPhone, but eventually will move to a different OTP app when I get my Librem5 (for which there is no Duo Mobile app).

GPG key update forDuo Unix
On November 4, 2019, we updated the GPG key used to sign Duo Unix distribution packages to improve the strength and security of our package signatures. If you are currently using this application, the next time that you upgrade the Duo Unix package via yum, apt, or apt-get, you will also have to update the key.Learn more in this Community post.If you are running Duo Unix on CentOS5, RHEL 5, Debian 6, or Debian 7, you do not need to update your GPG key as these distributions are no longer supported by Duo and the latest version of Duo Unix available on these distributions are signed using the deprecated GPG key. Note that the deprecated GPG key expires in August 2020, after which the GPG signature on these packages will fail to verify.

Duo Access Gateway 1.5.10released
Fixed an issue where users who could authenticate through first factor could modify the SAML response sent to the Duo Access Gateway and it would be accepted. This issue only affected Duo Access Gateways configured to use a SAML IdP authentication source. (DUO-PSA-2019-002).

Bug fixes
Corrected grammatical errors in an Admin Panel SSO error message. Previously, the error stated “SAML IdP assertion was rejected: The Message of the Response is not signed and the SP require it”. Now it states “SAML IdP assertion was rejected: SAML Response must be signed.”Read-only Administrators may no longer interact with the Change User Status button in the Duo Admin Panel. While this button was previously clickable, it had no effect on user status.Fixed issues with numbered list items in the administrator activation process for the Admin Panel.Fixed an issue where error messages on the Admin Panel login page would immediately “flicker” away if the administrator had a password manager autofill enabled.Fixed an issue on the Users and Admins pages in the Admin Panel that caused the LastPass plugin to autofill fields on those pages.

1809,https://community.duo.com/t/introducing-our-improved-azure-active-directory-sync/5778,Introducing our improved Azure Active Directory sync,Release Notes,,mkorovesisduo,https://community.duo.com/u/mkorovesisduo,11/8/2019,"Today, we finished releasing an updated version of ourAzure Active Directory (AAD) sync functionality. This update contains a number of long-requested features, including support for custom attributes and significant performance improvements for both single user and full synchronizations.
Let’s take a look at what this update adds.
Performance improvements for single user and full synchronizations
The speed at which single user and full synchronizations run have been greatly increased with this new implementation. For particularly large directories, the time for a single user sync has dropped from over 20 minutes to 2 to 3 seconds.
Custom attributes
For directory syncs, Duo selects default mappings for attributes. However, customers sometimes have unique directory structures and may need to use different attributes for username (including aliases), email, or telephone. This could be due to legacy decisions from local Active Directory mirroring up to Azure Active Directory in hybrid mode. To accommodate the unique structures of our customers’ directories, our goal is to allow customers to configure which field they will use for username (including aliases), email, phone number, and bring on additional fields from Active Directory.
Sync logging
Additional information will be made available to administrators in the logs regarding user metrics:
Users seen: Total number of users that were processed in the syncUsers added: Total number of new usersUsers removed: Total number of users removedUsers modified: Total number of changed users
Users seen: Total number of users that were processed in the sync
Users added: Total number of new users
Users removed: Total number of users removed
Users modified: Total number of changed users
Error reporting
Clearer error messaging that helps provide direction on how to manage an error appropriately.
More consistency between Azure AD and on-premises Active Directory
For customers who use both on-prem AD and AAD, there will be greater parity in the experience.
Updating to the new AAD sync
All customers on a paid edition of Duo have access to this new version. If you are currently using AAD sync, you will need to reauthorize your sync after opting in to the new version.
To utilize the new functionality and reauthorize your synchronization:
Log in to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate toUsers > Directory Sync.
Select your AAD sync configuration.
Check the box labeled “Use new sync” and then clickSave Directory.
After the page reloads, click theReauthorizebutton.
Complete authentication with the designated Azure service administrator account that has the global administrator role for the Azure Active Directory.
ClickAcceptin the prompt that appears.
Repeat this process for each of your AAD synchronizations.
If you set up anewAzure Active Directory sync, it will have the “Use new sync” box checked by default.
We hope you find these new features helpful. Please let us know if you have any questions about these updates.",1

Please advise. I confirmed that my keys are all correct. The code matches what is in the demo project. If I hard code the data-host value and an invalid data-sig-request value, the iframe actually appears but has a warning along the lines of “Access denied. The server may be out of sync.”",0

Set up an 2016 RRAS server and have L2TP and SSTP working fine. Set up Duo per the instructions atTwo-Factor Authentication for Microsoft RRAS VPN connections | Duo Securityand when a user tries to connect, get this in the event viewer and never get a push.
The following error occurred in the Point to Point Protocol module on port: VPN1-127, UserName: mvalpreda. The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server. Specifically, the authentication method used by the server to verify your username and password may not match the authentication method configured in your connection profile. Please contact the Administrator of the RAS server and notify them of this error.
Originally the authentication was MS-CHAP v2 on L2TP and SSTP. I kept that and then ticked CHAP - did that both in RRAS and on the client. I just did CHAP on both the client and server. Keep getting the error above in Event Viewer.

1.) When some of our users change their password in Office 365 Outlook will display “NEED PASSWORD” in the bottom status bar of Outlook. If the user attempts to click on it the Duo Window opens quickly and then closes without allowing them to enter their credentials. The only way I’ve been able to fix this is by using a registry hack that sets DisableAADWAM to True.
2.) A user is repeatedly prompted with the Duo login box when starting Outlook, they enter their credentials, the mouse spins, then the window closes. After a few seconds the Duo login box appears again. When I check the DAG logs it shows successful login for that user. Not sure what is going on.
Our AD is on-premise and we use the sync tool to sync AD to the cloud.",0

We have DUO on multiple servers and one of the things we would really love to see is the ability to set up an “Offline” access to the server that is not tied to a specific person. For example, if we set up a Yubikey as an offline authenticator on a server, have that be available to anyone logging into that server in case of internet access not being available (say an Internet Outage).  It isn’t a huge deal but it is something that would make it nicer when installing DUO on servers, that instead of having X number of “offline codes” in the app for the various servers, if there was the ability to have a yubikey plugged into the server that could be used as an offline authenticator for anyone with the ability to login to the server when the internet is out.",0

I can see two possible solutions.
Copy Duo-Web-v2.js out of the duo_web python package and put it into my Django project’s static files folder, so I can load it on the authentication page like a regular django static file, e.g.<script src=""{% static 'duo/js/Duo-Web-v2.min.js' %}""></script>
Use<script src=""https://■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■/frame/hosted/Duo-Web-v2.min.js""></script>(It looks like the forum software is censoring the domain for some reason… It’sapi.duosecurity. com.
The disadvantage of#1is that if Duo-Web-v2.js gets updated with a new version of the duo_web project, I have to manually search out that update and copy it into my django app again.
The disadvantage of#2is that I don’t know if Duo guarantees that that URL will remain valid in perpetuity, or if it will get updated and no longer be backward compatible with the version of duo_web that my app has installed.

My company has recently adopted Duo for authentication to servers/network devices. I work in automation; our homegrown automation platform currently allows users to login with ldap/active directory credentials, and they then invoke automation tasks on servers/network devices using machine-to-machine credentials stored in the automation platform for those servers/network devices. I would like to ask what strategies exist for allowing a user to login to my automation platform using Duo TFA, and then access the automation target devices using Duo as well?  Can Duo support having my automation platform users use the same auth token to access servers/network devices without having to re-authenticate?  Perhaps for a set amount of time?  How are others handling automation?  Thank you",0

New features, enhancements, and other improvements
Trusted Endpoints blacklist functionality
Duo Administrators can now blacklist an endpoint that was previously reported as a “Trusted Endpoint.” This can be useful in cases where the endpoint is reported lost or stolen.Blacklisting an endpoint will prevent it from gaining access to applications as long as there is an active Trusted Endpoints configuration for devices running the same OS as the endpoint.This capability will initially apply to macOS, Windows, and iOS endpoints for which Duo utilizes a certificate to determine whether the endpoint is trustworthy or not.Blacklisting can be configured via the endpoint’s detail page.

Individual user sync now available for Help Desk administrators
Duo Administrators with theHelp Desk rolecan now perform directory syncing of individual users, even ones not yet in Duo, from the directory sync page (which is otherwise read-only for them).They also continue to be able to perform individual user directory syncing from the user detail screen.Help Desk admins can now see the “Directory Sync” menu item under “Users” in the navigational menu on the left side of theDuo Admin Panel.

Miscellaneous enhancements
Modified directions in the Duo Mobile activation step of the sign-up process to clarify that the UI element that needs to be tapped is either “Add Account” or “+”.When an administrator’s authentication attempts arereset via the Duo Admin Panel, API, or self-remediation, an event is now logged in theAdministrator Actions Report. This was implemented in a previous release but was mistakenly left out of the release notes until now.

Example:A publicly accessible web pagehttps://www.example.comonly allows logins from white-listed ips.
If the public IP of the DNG is white-listed, and we configured DNG to link to the external url, would I be correct in assuming it would function to masquerade the users IP to be that of the the DNG when using the DNG url associated to the external website?
Currently for this site users need to VPN in, but I would think DNG could work for this scenario.

1881,https://community.duo.com/t/can-authentication-proxy-insert-an-attribute-not-just-pass-thru/4764,"Can Authentication Proxy insert an attribute, not just 'pass thru'",Authentication Proxy,,KNelson,https://community.duo.com/u/KNelson,6/18/2019,"Our scenario is we have network devices that we do DUO authentication for administrative access to the devices. This is generally accomplished via RADIUS by way of the DUO Authentication Proxy (DAP).
The simplest configuration is to configure DAP with a LDAP for primary authentication and a series of radius clients for our various devices.
This works great except for those devices that require the indication of an access level/role by way of a RADIUS-provided attribute (such as ‘priv=15’ or ‘role=sysadmin’). I can accomplish this when doing attribute pass-thru with RADIUS as the primary authentication but then I need to setup (in our Windows environment) NPS for RADIUS which is basically yet another proxy not unlike DAP itself. This creates another point of failure just to facilitate inserting the attribute required by network devices to assign the appropriate access.
What I perceive as being ideal is the ability to have DAP insert/inject these attributes directly by way of some additional attribute for each device/group of RADIUS clients (like an ‘insert_attribute_1’ and ‘insert_attribute_2’ corresponding to a ‘radius_ip_1’ and ‘radius_ip_2’ so each client/group can receive the response independently of others as each device requires).
Since there could be multiple attributes required, the value could perhaps be a delimited list (eg.insert_attribute=cisco-avpair= ”shell:priv-lvl=15“, cisco-avpair= ”shell:role=sysadmin“). I don’t have a complete understanding of all the possible options/variations on a RADIUS attribute so I’m not sure if this solution would work for all possible uses but I’m hoping smarter people could fill in gaps with relative ease.
Is there another way to accomplish getting these attributes communicated to RADIUS clients when using LDAP as the primary authentication that I’m missing?

1883,https://community.duo.com/t/u2f-using-phone-as-token/5327,U2F using phone as token,Managing Devices forum,,johnm,https://community.duo.com/u/johnm,9/15/2019,"Hello
I may be misunderstanding a few things here  and if so I’ll be pleased to be corrected.
My main use case is to use 2FA for unix logins. So far this works well with the pam_duo module in a server’s pam stack.  The operation is simply that pam_duo pushes an approval to the phone.  But this is not quite U2F as there is no cryptographic relationship proven as part of the authentication.
The strength of the Duo push process is in the proof provided by some biometric.  But this is still a level below U2F as a push is subject to an interception attack, before it reaches the device, isn’t it?
Duo has long supported U2F via some token that contains cryptographic material to use.  I’m wondering if Duo has or is considering leveraging a smartphone’s TrustZone feature to store keys in order to effect U2F, rather than relying on another physical device?
My own view is that I find USB tokens, attached to my car/house/etc keys a greater level of user friction than a smartphone biometric.  I find losing a phone less likely than losing keys and phones often  have the advantage of a remote control feature (eg Apple’s Find My Phone) that helps (disabling, locating, alerting) in such cases.
Many thanks

We’re trying to setup Duo to integrate with our SonicWALL SRA 4200 and so far it is successful with the primary configuration using[radius_server_iframe], however I’m looking to have this work with NetExtender as well but that doesn’t seem to be working when using the SonicWALL SRA alternative configuration atSonicWALL SRA or SMA 100 Series SSL with RADIUS Auto Push for VPN Client Access | Duo Securityand[radius_server_auto].
Our configuration is using[ad_client]for preauthentication, and the strange thing is that if a user tries to login with either NetExtender or the SSL VPN SRA webpage using[radius_server_auto]configuration, it will send a push notification to the user’s Duo Mobile app but nothing happens after that point. Before timing out, the user will receive one more push notification, wait a while, then the SRA webpage or NetExtender will return an error “Login server unreachable. Please contact your administrator or try again later.”
According to theauthproxy.logit shows preauth was successful then it triggered a push notification. Then Duo authentication returned ‘allow’: ‘Success. Logging you in…’ and it sent the response. The log pretty much stops at that point but then it repeats this process for that second Duo push. The only error I see here is between the auth and preauth stage with the following line:
[HTTPPageGetter (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] Invalid single ip:hostname.domain.name.
(Note: “hostname.domain.name” is not the actual data in the log, I just changed it here for privacy.)
I learned this was picked up from the SRA’s configured hostname underNetwork > DNS > SRA Appliance Hostname, and it actually didn’t matter whether I configured it to be a resolvable hostname or not. I even went so far as to change the hostname to the SRA’s IP address, which gave me a different result in the log to the effect of “valid IP” but like I said, no change in the overall behavior.
I also checked theconnectivity_tool.logbut it just reports no issues or connectivity problems detected.

You can set the Duo integrated applications to only allow authentication based on user group, but they still show up in the launcher to people who are not in that group. The bookmarks which are not duo integrated at all seem to be the only set of links that show up in the launcher that can be hidden per group.For example- we’re expecting only a few end user facing applications to go through the gateway, but dozens of IT specific ones. We don’t want it to clutter up the interface for end users but instead somewhat customize what they see based their needs.Is this something that i’m just not finding the config for?

We’re excited to announce thepublic beta of the Duo Device Health application, a new product capability that helps control which laptop and desktop devices can access corporate applications based on device security hygiene.
With the Device Health application, a Duo Admin can create Duo policies that require a device meet specific requirements including disk encryption, host firewall, device password and OS patch. This helps organizations more readily adapt to a zero-trust security model by providing their admins with the ability to:
Validate the health of a device at the time of authenticationEnable end users to proactively fix device security risksExtend visibility and control for unmanaged / BYO devices
Validate the health of a device at the time of authentication

Duo installed a few days ago (so latest Version is installed)
During login, the PUSH message is reaching my phone and I accept.

Since Windows credentials box does not come we can not do any action further to enter the password or to wait for DUO push screen which comes after entering the password.
The only solution to come out of this situation is to go to Safe mode boot on Windows and disable and uninstall Duo and come back to normal mode and log in again and then reinstall DUO to make DUO working.
Is there any permanent fix for it because we can not keep on uninstalling and installing the DUO in between the safe and normal boot mode? We already have the paid account with you.

If I click on the second one, it wants me to authenticate via Due Security but if I click on the first one, I can simply bypass Duo Security and log in without Duo requiring me to authenticate via MFA!

We are happy to share that the Duo Mobile app for Android will soon feature a dark theme. This feature will be available in Duo Mobile for Android version 3.29.0, which will be released on Tuesday, August 13, 2019. iOS users, don’t fret! A dark mode for the iOS version of the app is coming soon.
As with many other apps’ dark themes, this long-awaited functionality is intended to make the app easier to use in low-light conditions and for users with sensitive eyesight. It can also help save battery life by illuminating fewer pixels.
Here are a few screenshots to give you an idea of what this will look like:

For devices running Android Q (10.0), which is planned to be released this month, it is dependent upon the “Dark Theme” setting located in the Quick Settings dropdown menu.
Dark theme will be enabled or disabled based on the user’s system settings. On devices running Android Pie (9.0), whether or not it appears is primarily dependent upon whether the user has battery saver mode enabled. Note that only certain devices are firmware-enabled to support dark theme when battery saver mode is enabled and the system-wide “dark” setting in Android Pie has no impact on whether dark theme is utilized on user apps.
Also included in version 3.29.0 of Duo Mobile for Android are some slight design tweaks to the general appearance of the app outside of dark mode. The color of buttons and backgrounds throughout the app will change slightly, along with the color and size of text elements. Here is an example of the “tweaked” look in the “light” or regular theme:

We are pleased to announce that, beginning August 21, 2019, the Duo Admin Panel will feature a streamlined login process.
This workflow is intended to make the login process quicker and lead to fewer administrators clicking “Single Sign On” when it is not an available option for them.
Login experience for first visit after update
When you first navigate to the Duo Admin Panel login page, you will be prompted to enter your email.To enable the one-click login process, after entering your email, select the “Save my email address for next time” checkbox.Then clickContinue.
New Login 1.png541×951 64 KB
The next screen you see depends on the Authentication with SAML (SSO) option you have selected on theAdmin Login Settings page in the Duo Admin Panel.
Authentication with SAML Disabled
You will be asked for your password, and then can complete two-factor authentication.
Authentication with SAML Required
You will be taken to your IdP, and then can complete two-factor authentication.
Authentication with SAML Optional
You will be given a choice between Password login or SSO login. If you checked the “Save my email address for next time” box, your choice will be remembered.
Thenexttime you attempt to log in to the Duo Admin Panel, the experience will similarly depend upon the Authentication with SAML Admin Login Setting you have configured.
Login experience for subsequent visits
Authentication with SAML Disabled
If you do not have a SAML SSO configuration set up for Admin Panel login and you checked the “Save my email address for next time” box, you simply need to enter your password, click “Log in,” and complete two-factor authentication. You will have this login experience as long as you keep the “Save my email address for next time” box checked.

Authentication with SAML Required or Optional (and you checked “Save my email address for next time” and you first completed primary authentication through your identity provider)
If you do have SAML SSO set up for Admin Panel login, you will see a login page with your Duo Administrator email displayed and a “Continue to identity provider” button. Click the button to complete primary authentication via your identity provider.
New Login 3.png443×806 44.5 KB
After doing that, you will be brought back to the Duo Admin Panel login page to complete two-factor authentication.
You may click “Use password instead” to utilize the non-SAML SSO process for login, if it is allowed by your organization.If SAML SSO is optional and you used password authentication to complete primary authentication on your first login, you will be prompted to enter your password instead of being directed to your identity provider.A “Login with SSO” link is located beneath the password prompt if you would like to use that method instead. You may complete two-factor authentication after successfully entering your primary credentials.

I’m currently working on a new RDS farm with duo MFA and using HAProxy to pass connections to RD Gateway Servers.
The chain is something like this:Client → HAProxy → RD-Gateway → RD-Host
Everything so far is working, however I can’t figure out how to pass the original Client IP to the RD-Gateway and/or DUO.  Since all connections are identified as the proxy IP address, it’s not possible to differentiate clients or use whitelisting features.  On top of that, the DUO Push notification will always list the client location as the HAProxy’s IP address.
I’ve searched all over the DUO forums as well as:

RADIUS server sees NAS IP of Ubuntu server, even with conf file using nas_ip=x.x.x.x.

There’s a new tool available you will likely find useful if you write code in Python. We recently madeDlint, our approach to Python static analysis, publicly availableto the community for your use, feedback, and contributions.
Static analysis is an effective, low-cost way to identify potential problems in code. Our approach with Dlint aims to overcome some common challenges, such as how to identify dangerous uses of Python and make more informed, complex queries.
The initial release of Dlint contains a set of rules that check for common best-practices to writing secure Python. It’s easy to add new rules too, so you can contribute back to the community.
If you’d like to use Dlint on your next project, you will find thecode on Github.Give it a shot and let us know what you think!

They are looking for some more detailed analysis before including that patch, and it’s difficult for me to do that.  Can anyone from Duo jump in there and help out?  It seems like Duo is doing something weird that is triggering LOAD_ANONYMOUS in Firefox.

When the user clicks on send passcode or push notification button, the request is posted to the servlet and a notification is sent to the user’s phone. So my question is:is it possible to send push notification/Passcode to the user phone without displaying the DUO Authentication frame in the UI and asking the user to click on the button?
I don’t want to show this duo frame. Instead i directly want to send push or passcode notification to the phone.

After that, Bitwarden changes to the correct new passcode, and DUO still shows 15 seconds remaining for the OLD passcode.

Greetings. Curious to know if anyone is experiencing issues after logging into their respective admin portals for managing their Duo instances? This morning I have been logged out of our admin portal whilst navigating through it almost immediately after a successful login. Generally I am able to access maybe a couple of pages in the Admin Portal before being kicked out and presented with “***Your session timed out. Please login again.***” from our admin login portal. Our daily use web browser is Google Chrome Enterprise, and we are on the latest stable version (currently v75.0.3770.100 x64) on Windows 10 x64 v1803.
My co-workers have also experienced the same. The issue does not appear to manifest itself if using Chrome in Incognito Mode, nor does it appear if using Firefox. Suffice to say we have not tried either Edge or IE11 on Windows 10.

In the Two-factor authentication implementation of Duo with Web-SDK, we do the primary authentication of Duo with Duo user’s username using “sign_request(ikey, skey, akey, username)”.Here, my requirement is, instead of username, I want to authenticate with the email Id present in the email id field of the Duo user.
Is this possible?",0

i am performing Duo integration with RA VPN using MFA, however it is failing on last step to make it working. Connection towards Duo Cloud from Active directory Windows 2012 R2 that runs Duo Authentication proxy is failing. Note that AD does not have an direct connectivity and needs proxy connectivity. Proxy settings has been configured in [main] configuration section.

==============================================================================
If i do not define proxy settings in [main] section than the connectivity to Duo Cloud will provide failure on TCP timeout. So it’s seems that proxy settings are right now enforced, however not sure why the RestAPI query is still failing.
I have went through following connectivity checks:https://help.duo.com/s/article/1336?language=en_US
all works fine, apart from telnet and power shell connectivity checks since the windows system environment variable with defined http/https proxy settings does not seems to be enforced as i see traffic leaving the box directly to internet which will be obviously filtered.
all works fine, apart from telnet and power shell connectivity checks since the windows system environment variable with defined http/https proxy settings does not seems to be enforced as i see traffic leaving the box directly to internet which will be obviously filtered.
So question is, what connectivity tool checks are being executed since when i access Duo Rest API call manually over browser, all seems to go fine via proxy as i am getting valid certificate issued by Duo.
Additionally, how can I interpret following message:"" The connectivity tool unfortunately doesn’t use the proxy parameters in the [main] section to then test the rest of the sections present inauthproxy.cfg, giving a potentially misleading result from that tool. We definitely have plans to fix this.""Source:DUO Auth proxy via http proxy fails to connect
so does the connectivity tool properly enforce proxy settings in later connectivity verification steps? Is connectivity to Duo Cloud supported over proxy? (based on information on website it seems that it is)  Are there any proxy limitations in case I am not using Duo Authentication proxy application as an proxy itself on the server and remote proxy supports CONNECT method.

This is pretty tedious since we can’t deliver them directly to the end users.We can configure them as U2F which is awesome and much more simple but unfortunately, Online mode doesn’t support U2F yet
I’ve been told that DUO was planing to support it in a future version, so I’d like to know if there is some developments about that new feature.
Here is the comment I received from DUO support few months ago
We do plan on supporting U2F for online mode next year. U2F offline is supported today because we got it to work locally, but the way U2F typically works requires a completely different codepath so we need to build the infra up to our cloud service. For online mode today, users will still have to use the Yubikeys as OTP mode which requires it to be programmed. For offline mode or any other web based integration supporting our iframe, U2F can be used and they can be self-enrolled easily by the end user without any configuration from the Yubikey Personalization tool and Duo admin panel.

I tried putting a second entry with other interfaces but errors that is duplicate.
Any ideas?  Thank you.",0

This line (#33) that generated this error in the openvpn.conf is as follows:plugin /opt/duo/duo_openvpn.so ‘xxxxx yyyyyy zzzzzzzzz’
I saw that there was an error using this syntax with OpenVpn (v2.4.1-2)
Reference posting here:(Latest OpenVPN Update (v2.4.1-2) Breaks duo_openvpn.so)and the solution there was to enclose the 3 keys for the plugin in single quotes ’ '. Is this a known issue with OpenVpn 2.4.6 and is there any workaround for this error?

Duo integrates with your OpenVPN server to add two-factor authentication to any VPN login.
and I have tried using double quotes and no-quotes but the error is the same after restarting the openvpn server. Because of this error, openvpn server fails to start and I have commented out loading of the duo plugin for now.
Let me know if this should be investigated further with Support/Engineering.

I’m an Owner use of a Duo implementation which has been active across multiple applications for several years.  As an Identity and Access specialist, I rarely am heavily involved with Application setup, but my team does use the Admin console quite heavily and my Feature Requests that I’ve sent to Duo Support have the most impact on Admin console usability and functionality.  Unfortunately, I may be the only such requester for these features and hope that other Duo customers will see value in my requests and submit their own Feature Requests to increase the priority of my own.  My top requests:

Our Help Desk Role did not have the ability to sync Single Users and we needed multiple reps to have that functionality, so all Service Desk Representatives now have the User Manager role.  This has caused erroneous full-directory syncs, Manual addition of users, and changes to Directory attributes by Service Desk reps as their security is now much too broad.  Per the feature request above, tracking down who did what is an onerous process.   Please add the ability to sync Single Users as a standalone feature and enable that feature in the Help Desk role - it might be useful to have that as a toggled option so that other facilities can opt out if needed.

What is odd is when we login to the Palo we get a Duo push notification. After hitting approve the username/password disappear on the Palo login page and in red “invalid username and or password” pops up. In the Duo logs we can see where the auth starts and validates the user logging in, shows that the push was approved and that access was granted and then there are two disconnect statements due to “Attempt to bindRequest multiple times in the same LDAP connection.  Disconnecting.” (Please note IP’s have been replaced with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and the username has also been removed and replaced with user.name)

This change has not stopped us from being able to login using Duo on all other PA not on PANOS 8.1.x. Has anyone else had this issue? We are also working with Palo TAC to see if it is a bug in PANOS.

I’m having a heck of a time figuring out how to integrate Duo with SonicWall TZ SSL-VPN logins. I understand I’m supposed to follow the instructions in the generic RADIUS guideTwo-Factor Authentication Using RADIUS | Duo Securityhowever in our implementation user logins are validated against Active Directory via LDAP, and as I understand it doing RADIUS would just mess things up.
Obviously I don’t understand this very well and when I searched these forums I found a few others that may have implemented the same thing.
This help articlehttps://help.duo.com/s/article/4500?language=en_USsays the user authentication method needs to be RADIUS (currently ours is set to “Local Users + LDAP”). So that’s one source of confusion.
I also read through the authproxy reference guideDuo Authentication Proxy Reference | Duo Securityfor configuring the Authentication Proxy for RADIUS, but I don’t quite understand this.

Both of the above are supposedly achievable via the same method, by removing the [radius_server_iframe] section from the config files. In my case, since I’m using Duo as secondary authentication, the config file should look like below.

Previously, third-party accounts had to be manually reconnected to Duo Mobile one-by-one.
We have created two videos that explain how to enable and use Duo Restore for Third-Party Accounts.

I have enrolled several users but they are configured for failopen on the devices, so when offline they are able to bypass Duo.
If I now enable offline authentication and enrollment in the ‘windows RDP’ application, will this affect them in any way?
Once I have enabled offline access, can I just disable failopen for those users and they will be able to use Duo offline with the bypass codes?",0

So we are integrating Duo with Office 365 via Azure AD Conditional Access policies.  Our Azure AD is currently integrated with our AD via ADFS 3.0 environment.  The problem we’re running into is the O365 thick clients (Outlook / Skype / Teams) are prompting users for credentials when it shouldn’t.
User launches Outlook/Teams/Skype
Client pops up the Microsoftonline login window asking for email address
User provides company email and is redirected to our ADFS login page
ADFS Login page prompts for username/password
Duo prompts
User is logged in.
The problem is Step 4 shouldn’t happen if the user is on our internal network.  ADFS uses “windows authentication” when you’re on the internal network which allows for transparent login (user doesn’t type in credentials).  This works perfectly for websites, likeOutlook.office.comor any other web based app we have integrated with Azure AD, but not the Outlook/Skype/Teams clients.
Anyone run into this and find a way to fix it?  I really don’t want people having to log into Office more often just because of Duo (even if it is once every 60-90 days).",0

No network access at all.I’ve looked at the NPS and I can’t see anything that would affect it. Perhaps using PAP needs a special policy?

It does have the ability to do SSO via its container (Tomcat in this case).  We use Duo Access Gateway for SAML-based SSO to cloud apps, and ideally would do the same with this thing, so I was curious if anyone has successfully integrated Duo’s Access Gateway with Tomcat?  I have a rough idea that such an integration may be possible with Spring’s SAML gateway, but have not gone down that path yet.  Not as ideal, but another option, would be for me to do Tomcat-level active directory / ldap auth, but I’d still want to hook traditional Duo MFA into that, so I’d still need to figure out how to do that piece if that’s any easier than DAG/SAML+Tomcat.
Duo support doesn’t provide any guidance on either option; they’ll just point you at the java github clienthttps://github.com/duosecurity/duo_client_javawhich is not really applicable.

It did seem to resolve itself out, but it brought the issue to the forefront and I wanted to know what others are doing to mitigate any interruption caused by it.  (This may only actually impact a small number of Duo customers, but those may be the customers with the larger user bases).

For phasing in Duo we would like to enable enrollments based on Active Directory sync using “Office1 Users” security group and “Office2 Users” security group. These AD groups currently contain various AD user objects including real users, shared calendars, generic user objects, etc but I only want to sync users that have an employeeID AND mail AD attribute.
I’m using this in the Duo Auth Proxy config file to filter only users that have those attributes:

Note: asterix=wildcard… that symbol won’t show in this post
However, when I add “Office1 Users” to the Duo portal settings under Users->Directory Sync->Active Directory-> Choose Groups… ALL users in “Office1 Users” get synced including those without mail or emplyeeID.

2078,https://community.duo.com/t/using-duo-to-protect-palo-alto-global-protect-vpn/1784,Using Duo to protect Palo Alto Global Protect VPN,VPN,,mmcgrath,https://community.duo.com/u/mmcgrath,11/2/2017,"Hi all.  I’m new to Duo and new to the Duo community; so hopefully this is a good place to post this.
With a little help I was able to get Duo setup to protect my Palo Alto VPN gateway.  About 80 people use the VPN, however, I am only testing with 4 users (including myself).  After entering a username and password and clicking ‘Connect’, the connection waits for the user to interact with Duo – this is GREAT!
Upon tapping ‘Approve’ from the Push Notification you get connected to VPN and all is well; it’s perfect!  Further testing led me to try tapping ‘Deny’.  Answering the ‘Why are you denying…?’ question with either option produces the same result.  Duo shows the ‘Denied!’ message – but I still move forward and successfully connect to VPN.
The logs on my proxy server show the following:
2017-11-01T20:17:36-0500 [HTTPPageGetter (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] ((‘10.5.1.50’, 45383), 92): Duo authentication returned ‘deny’: 'Login request denied.'2017-11-01T20:17:36-0500 [HTTPPageGetter (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] ((‘10.5.1.50’, 45383), 92): Returning response code 3: AccessReject2017-11-01T20:17:36-0500 [HTTPPageGetter (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] ((‘10.5.1.50’, 45383), 92): Sending response
From my limited knowledge it would appear that all is working.  Am I missing something simple?

Authentication flow goes something like this:
User logs in to the client user their AD username/password.
The Duo window pops up requesting an authentication method (Push, Call, or Code)
User takes too long accepting the push or entering a code generated by the Duo Security app
Upon successful authentication, the Duo window closes and Windows goes back to the login prompt after timing out.

This has quickly become the bane of our working lives and has seriously impacted productivity.  It appears that weak connectivity means that Duo isn’t robust enough to consider that the connectivity isn’t there and instead times out, wiping out whatever progress you had from the app that initiated the Duo pop-up in the first place.  There does not seem to be any prior notification that a Duo Push is pending.  For instance, if I try to access my email ahead of time for an important client meeting t join a Skye or WebEx, this inevitably is when Duo gets all need and wants attention.

Duo Prompt notification for users with Chinese phone numbers
Due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to deliver automated phone calls for authentication to users with +86 (Chinese) numbers. We have added a message to the Duo Prompt that will appear to users with a device with a +86 phone number.The message links tothis Knowledge Base article.This issue only affects phone callback authentication. All other authentication methods, including phone-based options such as Duo Push and SMS passcodes, are not affected.We are making this change to prevent the negative experience of continuing to attempt the use of a Duo authentication method that we are aware will not work.This change to the Duo Prompt will be rolled out following our standard phased deployment process for stability and efficiency and will be rolled out to all accounts by the end of April 15, 2019.We will keep the Knowledge Base article updated with the latest as we learn more and attempt to resolve this issue.

When attempting to access via the Office 365 portal it prompts for MFA correctly.However, I can install Office on a test PC using the account and it lets me in to Outlook without any MFA prompt!

Two-Factor Authentication Using LDAP
I used this method. Because In our case we use duo just on access from internal network to internal application using authentication proxy ldap solution. Most of out application is based ldap authentication.
Problem is when I’m login ldap application, duo send me only push notification but we want to use passcode or other 2fa method.
Can we show this window when we access authentication proxy?
If not possible how to use passcode, hardware tokens code, sms etc?
We used factors=passcode,push

I’m brand new here and looking to implement Duo for 2FA on some Linux machines. So far the documentation has been pretty much spot on and I’ve been able to install, configure, and use this with multiple users on a test CentOS 7.6 VM. I’m able to enable SELinux and configure it to allow for successfulsshlogins, but it seems to break local logins. What happens is that I enter my password at the local login prompt and it seems to hang for a few seconds, then it simply forgoes the Duo 2FA and logs me in. So, it seem to break in a bad way as itallowsthe login instead of denying it. As I mentioned,sshlogins as well assudo -icontinues to work as expected with SELinux enabled, but not local logins.
Now I don’t pretend to have any real experience or knowledge with SELinux, so this may be a dumb question, but I’d like to know how, if possible, I can configure SELinux to allow Duo 2FA withbothlocal and remote logins. I had experienced similar problems with FreeOTP which I had been experimenting with before. When I found out that my institution has a site license for Duo, I began to work on implementing my 2FA with Duo in lieu of FreeOTP.
As far as I can tell, this is a complete solution, if I can just get local logins to work with SELinux enabled, I’ll be done. Any help experts here can provide would be vastly appreciated. I’ve not yet reached out to Duo support properly as I’m not officially linked to the site license so I’m currently playing with a free account.
I can provide SELinux logs (i.e.,/var/log/audit/audit.log data) and other salient information likesealert -loutput as needed but I didn’t want to do that right away to keep this (my first post) clean.
Please help?

Im aware of the fact that multiple applications can connect to the same proxy server on the same port thought. But what bothers me a bit, is the fact, that on the duo authentication log ( on the website) the “Application” is shown as i configured it.
But what if i have multiple applications, which uses these ? Is it somehow possible to split these ?Else i have a bunch of users who connects to a global “LDAP Application”.
Is there a way to solve this somehow  ?

(if deletes or inserts happen while retrieving all)
e.g.
lets say there are groups:
test1, test2, test3, test4
Then I call /groups with limit of 2.  I get a next offset of 2 (since offset 0 and 1 were sent back in first call.)
Then someone else deletes “test1”.  Then when calling /groups with an offset of 2, then test4 is returned.  And not test3!  There is a missing record!
Instead it should do paging by returning the ID of last one returned, and pass that in the next call as “return after this ID”, and it will be consistent with no race conditions.
This seems like an important bug right?

Are distribution groups not supported or not recommended?

If you had enabled the “Require FIPS 140-2 encryption on Android passcodes” option before this change, then the setting will remain in effect for passcodes generated on Duo Mobile for Android versions older than 3.25.0. It had no effect on push notifications.
Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements for increased stability.
Note that push notifications and HOTP passcodes in Duo Mobile for iOS are already FIPS 140-2 compliant.

Today, we released version 3.0 of theDuo Authentication Proxy. Therelease notes in the documentation are available here, but here is a quick overview of the notable changes:
Default minimum TLS version moved to TLSv1.2
To improve the security of our product, we have moved our default minimum TLS version for the Duo Authentication Proxy from SSLv3 to TLSv1.2. This change only affects versions Authentication Proxy versions 3.0 and newer.This change only affects Authentication Proxy configurations using a[radius_server_eap]or[ldap_server_auto]section.If you wish to use older protocols (specifically, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, or TLSv1.1) with Authentication Proxy version 3.0 or newer, you will need to edit your proxy configuration file to include theminimum_tls_versionparameter and a specified TLS version. This parameter requires Authentication Proxy version 2.12.0 or newer.If your applications can only use TLS protocol versions older than TLSv1.2, your authentication workflow will not work if you upgrade to Authentication Proxy version 3.0 and do not configure this parameter.If you do not upgrade your Authentication Proxy to version 3.0 or newer, you do not need to define a minimum TLS version to continue using older protocols. However, we always recommend using the most up-to-date version of our software to ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.

Log folder permissions for the Linux Authentication Proxy
When Authentication Proxy 3.0 or newer is installed on a Linux system, it will create a group (duo_authproxy_grp) and assign the logs folder and all of its files as readable only by this group. This group name is customizable.Prior to this change, the log directory was readable by all users.Administrators that use a SIEM that is reading from these logs, may no longer be able to read these log files. They will have to add the user their SIEM process is running under to the same group that has permission to read the Authentication Proxy logs.

We have setup the Duo UNIX application in each of the MSP accounts.

My normal RADIUS implementation works fine, from my DUO auth proxy box (with it all turned off) I can ssh to the router using domain credentials, running a packet capture on the NPS I can see requests and responses and authentication succeeds.
When DUO enters the equation things get a bit more difficult. I have configured the authproxy.cfg as follows:;CLIENTS:; Radius#Lab[radius_client]host=192.168.254.59secret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; port=

In the case of an actual failure this may be due to a misconfigured secret or network issues.

I have configured the router with the duoauthproxy server as the RADIUS server and see authentication packets being sent to the NPS by the duoauthproxy server, one Access-Request packet followed by 3 more duplicate requests but no responses.

After typing in their username and password, a user is prompted to complete two factor. By tapping the key, a user can generate a unique passcode that grants them access to Facebook or Google’s suite of cloud-based productivity apps (formerly known as Google Apps).

I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. So… I had my university ITS program thesecond sloton my Yubikey Plus (you might not be familiar with that model, but it dates from roughly 2014 and supports OTP and U2F). The Duo-based university central auth system supports Yubikey OTP. After my token was programmed and registered, I tried it out. The first login, it worked like a charm. The second time, I get a message:
This passcode has already been used. Please generate a new passcode and try again.
Tried different browser and different university web site to login to, and keep getting this error.University ITS says they can’t help me now - don’t know what’s wrong and can’t be bothered to find out, because they are basically doing me a favor by letting me bring my own token, whereas normal policy is to only sell tokens that they buy from Yubico and program fresh for users who need them.
Forum, you are my last hopeUnless you can tell me how to tell them how to fix this problem, I’m probably stuck continuing to use the phone app for 2FA, which is a hassle for anyone accustomed to hardware tokens. I realize that it might ultimately be related to the fact that my Plus is so old that something has changed, and it just won’t work no matter what. But not gonna buy a new token from them, because they have a bunch of Y4s that they probably won’t run out of for quite a while. At least if they were selling the new Y5s for the same price, I would consider itThanks for reading.",0

This is perfect but I would like to have the second set of options presented first, and click “Login” without choosing a 2FA option and be presented with the “Voice Call” only button for the landline.  Except doing it the second way doesn’t work.  I understand that’s probably controlled by Keeper, and if so I’d like to know if there is some other way to get a backup landline call?
On the Keeper password prompt I tried entering ,phone2 but it says my password is incorrect.
Is there some other way to use the landline number without having it presented as the primary choice?",0

The following is text I sent to the Duo support email address hoping to get an answer, but unsurprisingly in retrospect, they refused, since I’m not a customer. Hope someone can answer me here. I’m a staff member at a US university, who is a software developer, but not involved with the ITS org at the university that uses some Duo product (not sure which) as part of our central auth system (CAS). From here on I’ll quote my email, with minimal changes, so I don’t have to edit too much:
At my university, we are using your product to integrate with our CAS to provide (among other things of course) the ability to do 2FA with Yubikeys. However the way the software is set up, I am required abuya new Yubikey 4 blank from our ITS. This is apparently (as I understand it) because the only way to register the Yubikey into the Duo software is to copy/paste code numbers that are emitted from the programming phase of the Yubico software.
The problem for me is that I already have some Yubikeys and don’t want to buy new ones. I’ve been through a long back-and-forth with our point person on this end trying to get an answer to the question “WHY can’t I just REGISTER my existing Yubikeys in Duo?” Finally, after I met her in person and listened in detail to all the steps in the workflow, that I understood what I have mentioned above - that it seems the ONLY way to register a key is to program (or reprogram) it immediately before registering, so that the internal PKC codes can be pasted directly into Duo.
If you are working in support at Duo, I’m sure you must understand that the concept of the Yubikey was never intended to be one in which you have adifferentYubikey on your keychain for each and every site that you need to authenticate to. The idea is that you can have just ONE, and use it with many different sites.
In my (reasonably technologically well-informed) imagination, there shouldn’t be anything needed to register my existing key beyond plugging it in somewhere, being prompted to press the key’s button when it flashes, and…being done. This is how it worked when I registered my key withfastmail.com. This is how it worked when I registered my key withfacebook.com*. Those registrations both happened right over the web from my own PC. I hope you can imagine how frustrating it is for me to learn that it’s not just this simple when I want to use my existing key at work. Even if I need to travel in person to my ITS office to get a registration done, that is not a problem at all.
Can you explain to me whether there is, in fact, a way to register my existing keys with whatever is the software product that my university is using, WITHOUT reprogramming them (which would mean that our ITS staff over here are insufficiently familiar with your software) or whether they are in fact correct, and there is NO WAY to register an existing key without reprogramming it?
Thank you.
Edit: I have seenthis. But I can’t quite make sense of the fact that it says “Duo supports 3P OTP tokens”, presumably also pre-programmed ones, but still explains that you need to provide these internal numbers. My understanding is that these numbers cannot be retrieved from a Yubikey once it is programmed.
* I suppose I should point out that my university is only supporting OTP, not U2F, and with facebook I’m using U2F.",0

This server is running CentOS 7, and has a few local user accounts
root - needs duouser1 - needs duouser2 - uses ssh key login only, doesn’t need duouser3 - needs duo
the base install and config works well for the root and user1 and user3 … but doesnt let user2 in the door (as expected) . I thought the answer was to have the
pushinfo = yesgroups = *,!user2
in the config file … that seems to allow user2 to login via ssh with no password prompt at all.  which is not good. (other users with this config still get the duo prompt)
I’m assuming this is because the default install comments out theauth       substack     password-authline in PAM?
Any ideas out there for this?

Greetings. Wondering if the following scenario is possible, and if not, what would be the recommended course of action to take:
Currently, we have our Office 365 and another third-party application protected via Duo. As such, any logins to either application from our “trusted” ip addresses results in the Duo MFA prompt for a split second, then passing the ADFS login through as they are identified to originate from the aforementioned trusted network. Logins from outside our trusted ip addresses still prompt for MFA as expected.
We now have a new vendor and application that we are able to tie into our ADFS login, but this application needs to be prompted for MFA for all logins (note, the vendor has our ip addresses white listed, so no logins are permissible from any other network).
So, is the scenario as described possible without breaking our current configuration with ADFS, or are there other options to consider/implement?
Thanks in advance for any comments/solutions to my query.

I’m running into some issues with doing an implementation of Duo on a few servers in my Linux environment.
I’m following pretty accurately the guide that is posted atDuo Unix - 2FA for SSH with PAM Support (pam_duo) | Duo Securityand I’ve noticed something. When I enter in a username that’s in Duo, it’ll take me right to the Duo screen, asking for either an SMS code, a phone code, or a push. It never prompts me for a password. This is not the behavior I am looking for. I am looking for it to allow me to enter in a password, and then prompt me for a Duo Push, so a true 2FA.
We’re only looking to do this on a password login right now, so I’m only concerned about the system-auth file. I’m running Oracle Linux 7, so I’m using the instructions designed for RHEL7 currently.

I’ve installed it perthe instructionsand everything is working great. SSH logins andsudoinvocations get challenged with a duo prompt, which is exactly what I want.
However, last night the server suffered a failed drive and the hosting company techs needed to log in to replace & rebuild the drive. The failed drive was part of a software raid 1 set and the techs wanted local root access via IPMI to do the necessarymdadmvoodoo to rebuild the mirror.
Fortunately, when they contacted me with the trouble ticket, I was in a spot where I could immediately log onto the server and temporarily disable duo, which seemed to be the most expedient way to get them logged in so the problem could be fixed.
It seems like it would be easier for future incidents if I could exclude the root account from duo protection so that they can log in as needed. I already have root login via ssh disabled, so my understanding is this wouldn’t broaden my attack surface in any meaningful way (yes, keyboard root logins would be unprotected by duo, but if you’ve got physical access to the server, all bets are off anyway). There’s no PII on the server and my concern is with keeping potential attackers out, rather than datacenter techs on break/fix work.
tl;dr- Is there an easy way to exclude root from duo prompts? Would this potentially be as simple as logging into my duo admin console and creating a user named “root” and setting that user’s duo status to “bypass”? Or are there some config files to deal with?

I imagine this would need to be a password plugin for OpenLDAP; maybe something else?
We use LDAP across 70+ Linux hosts for all ssh sessions, as well as authenticating all of our web based applications (only one supports Duo natively).
What I want is to create a “duo” security group in LDAP and add users to it. Whenever a user initiates a login requiring an LDAP query, the LDAP process sees it needs to run /usr/sbin/login_duo as well as verify the user password via SASL or userPassword attribute. This would allow enabling Duo auth for every single piece of software we have – weather it supports duo or not, regardless of how PAM or ssh is setup.
I’ve written an OpenLDAP plugin to do this for WiKID (RADIUS) in the past but wondering if Duo has this problem already solved to save me the headache of re-tooling the plugin.
I’m re-tagging this with Duo Labs in hopes it will reach some of the ninjas there since it’s likely a crazy idea.

I have just installed offline access to a Windows 2016 server (stand alone server) within an AWS test environment.  While the test instance I have does have outgoing Internet access, I have created the NACLs to the 5 DuO subnets to emulate the real environment there will be no Internet access.    I have a few questions / my observations regarding the use of DuO in a truly offline environment:
a) The server needs to connect to the internet for the installation work?  I have seen that you have to enter the API keys, etc.  When it is offline, the enablement of the service cannot be achieved?
b) Follow on question from a) if the server is truly offline how can the server know how many authentications are permitted for a user/how many days the user has authenticated?
c) It appears that the server needs to be connected to the internet initially to support the activation of the users to enable them to move from online users to offline users.  (I might have this wrong…)
d) I  have configured the RDP server to support offline access.  It does work, but there is a 15 second delay, before the RDP session prompts for the offline access.  it seems to imply, that it is trying to communicate with the DuO servers and it then fails to connect and then prompts the user.  Is there a setting that can reduce this delay so it just displays the offline authentication straight away.
It might be that the environment I have in a truly offline mode is not intended for the use of DuO, as the servers I am using are within a closed network with no internet access.  It might be plausible to place a proxy in, to  support the outgoing traffic to the DuO servers.  I would need to know about the target DuO environment, and look to implement further security controls to support the connectivity to the your servers.

I have set up Duo on a client server that we manage. and retain root to.  Our requirements are:
No change to our users on the server (i.e no 2FA)
2FA only present for users who are in the duo2fa Unix group, and only after key and password auth has passed
Duo account remains in client’s name (We do not want to manage SSH users via a control panel)
I’ve tested many scenarios and this mostly works for our users, but the client’s user keeps asking for 2FA even after I provide all the correct details.
My configs as follows:/etc/pam.d/sshd:
@includecommon-authauth   required   pam_permit_if.so user ingroup duo2faauth   required  /lib64/security/pam_duo.so
What else is required to get the client’s user, which exists in the duo2fa group, to require an ssh key and password for auth, and then succeed once the 2FA succeeded?

My currently Flow is:
Cisco Anyconnect —> Cisco ISE ----> Duo Proxy A port 1812/18120|-----> Duo Proxy B port 1812/18120
The ASA that terminates the anyconnect looks to Cisco ISE for its “RADIUS server” Then in Cisco ISE I have configured two Radius Token identity servers, Proxy A and Proxy B both listening on both ports.
I am using 2 ad_client fields in the config that match to 2 radius_server_auto fields. This is how I can achieve the listening of two ports for Radius for two separate domains.
Each Radius Token looks to Proxy A as primary and Proxy B as secondary both configured for different ports.
Some issues I am having is timing when it comes to “timeouts”. Also sometimes a user will login to the VPN without being prompted for DUO on their personal device and get connected, then they will disconnect and reconnect and they get DUO push…So thats puzzling.
Recently I fell on this article where it says my configuration of flow is completely wrong:
https://finkotek.com/cisco-anyconnect-with-ise-and-duo-mfa/
Saying that the ASA should be looking to the DUO proxy then Duo Proxy looks to ISE. But that confuses my load balancing ideas. Unless the Proxies go behind a F5 LTM VIP and both Proxies look to ISE? But then Load balance ISE too?
I need someone who has done this before successfully. I also cant seem to monitor the Duo Proxies easily either with F5. That may be a whole different issue.

I want to be able to know what I’m talking about with our IT people, so I figured I’d ask to see if this is even possible before talking to them.
We use LibCal through Springshare, and LibCal can integrate with Microsoft Outlook to let students (among other things) schedule appointments with librarians. LibCal previously just needed the Outlook server address, the email address, and the password. Now that Duo’s in place, LibCal returns a “SOAP client returned status of 401” error.
So my question, for when/if we talk to our IT department: does Duo have options that would allow LibCal to be whitelisted, to let it bypass the second authentication step?

Before this change, Windows 8, Windows 7, and other older versions were treated as EOL. After this change, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7 will be considered supported, while Windows 8 and other older versions will continue to be considered EOL.
If you use policies to block or warn Windows 7 devices, we encourage you to consider how this will impact your security posture.This change will allow previously-blocked Windows 7 devices to gain access. If you want to continueblocking or warningWindows 7 devices, you will need to update your policy configuration.
Specifically, we are making the following changes to ourWindows Operating System policy control:
Updating our definition of “End-of-Life” to match “End-of-Extended-Support” instead of “End-of-Mainstream-Support” as prescribed byMicrosoft’s Fixed Lifecycle Policy.This will change Windows 7 from EOL to Supported.We feel comfortable making this change because Microsoft continues to push security updates to systems running those versions of the OS. With this change, starting today, November 14, Duo will consider:Windows 7 to be be supported until January 12, 2020Windows 8.1 to be supported until January 10, 2023Starting today, November 14, the Duo policy control for Windows Operating System will be updated to reflect this change. When configuring OS policies in the Admin Panel you will see that EOL versions are Windows 8, Windows Vista, and below, but no longer Windows 7.

I have a customer that’s looking to setup DUO for their SonicWALL SSLVPN appliance. The firmware is 8.6+ so we can’t use the web console we have setup RADIUS auth and it’s working fine.
My issue is since we are using MSCHAPv2 the users can’t append their 2FA choice at login since the DUO proxy can’t see the password string so it defaults to the DUO app.
Most of the clients are using the DUO Moble App but a select few sometimes have the need to connect to the VPN but they won’t have their devices handy so they want the ability to add a landline to their account and use that to connect to the VPN.
My issue/question when I try and test this even when I use the self-service portal to change the default device to the landline and then connect to the VPN it always sends a push and never a call. If I remove the mobile device from the users profile it makes a call without issue. Is there a way to make the call work while keeping the mobile device setup on the users profile?

Bug fixes
Fixed bugs causing links to be opened in the incorrect tab when CMD- or CTRL- clicking (for Mac and Windows, respectively) metric links in the Duo Admin Panel.When a Duo Administrator enters a custom time range filter on the Authentication Log report, the start and end dates are validated for correctness.The start date time cannot occur after the end date time.The start date time must be less then or equal 180 days before the current date.The date time range cannot span more than 180 days.When creating a new on-premises Active Directory or OpenLDAP Directory, the Port field will no longer wrap to the next line when validation errors for the Hostname or Port field occur.When viewing a user’s details in the Duo Admin Panel, the Add Alias button no longer appears if that user is read-only either due to being a synced user or from being moved to the trash.Fixed a bug whereby a Duo Administrator was able to add users to groups managed by directory sync. Admins will now (correctly) not be able to add users to those groups.

I want to configure a policy that allows bypass across different applications based on an Active Directory group that would be synced. However if the user is synced, they’re partially enrolled and then must complete enrollment and thus consume a license.
The alternative that appears to be the only solution is to configure OU_Exempt on each application within the config of the DUO auth proxy. However, managing a user and determining how they’re configured by looking at AD group membership is easier than and OU path. OU path may change for an account, and thus cause unexpected results.
Are there any alternatives to an OU_Exempt by using an AD group that do not involve partially enrolling users?",0

For example, we define an Administrator user, and associate the phones of all three company sys admins with that user. This allows any one of those sys admins to login to a Duo enabled server, select their phone from the drop-down and login. This ability to assign multiple phones to a user is a wonderful and critical Duo feature for us.
The only problem is that, even when a sys admin picks their phone from the drop-down, it seems to also push to another phone–probably the one that’s first in the list.
Any idea why this is happening and how we can make sure it only pushes to the selected phone?",1

Hi there. I’m testing out the duo insight product and  it seems that google is marking everything from the domain namecollaborate-signin.comas a phishing attempt. I have added the IP address and domain name to the whitelist as per these instructions:https://insight.duo.com/support
Last week, when I tested Duo, I was able to choose the domain nameportal-login-online.comwhich was not marked as a phishing attempt. Unfortunately, today, I am unable to choose this domain. I see that if I choose other services instead of GSuite, I am able to change the sender email. Why is the GSuite service restricted to justcollaborate-signin.com? I am only givencollaborate-signin.comas a choice.
Any insight would be very helpful. Thanks!",0

So when the I/T help desk gets a call from a fellow employee to unlock their user account (for Windows, as an example), we do not have an easy way to verify that the caller is who they say they are.  What we would like to do is give every employee a Duo keyfob, and when someone calls us for an unlock, the I/T staff can push a random six digit code to that users keyfob.  The caller would then read that number back to the I/T staff (who can obviously see and know the code) which would then verify that we are speaking with the correct person.

We use the same LDAP Proxy application from DUO and it works with other applications.  FireMon is accepting the authentication but DUO is not prompting for 2FA.
FireMon has little information for DUO+LDAP Proxies.  Does anyone have any experience with FireMon and setting up 2FA for it or know if it will work?

OneDriveMapper makes use of session tokens stored in IE to authenticate to 365 - not a problem with Duo as we bypass MFA while in Citrix.
The problem we’ve come across is that some users are no longer prompted with “Keep Me Signed In” on the 365 login page meaning the token is not generated thus as user passwords are expiring so are the tokens, breaking the drive mapping.

However, After that logging on to the “app” is be carried out via proximity: Once the user is within range of a certain geographic peremiter, the user should sign in via DUO.Meaning: The user walks into our building, and is required to authorise themselves on their phone via duo mobile. There is no browser or interactive app (besides duo) at that stage.
To make this happen I need is 2 things:
At the service signup stage ( with the webrowser) , how do I constrain the duo signup to allow only non-interactive push notifications? (no codes,no sms’s, nothing that would require interaction through a webform)
At a later date, when I use my own hardware to detect a “login” request, how can I initiate a push request to the users’ iphone, without them having to open a browser? [ which DUO API should I use?]",0

I’d greatly appreciate any insight or alternatives that others may have implemented to allow multiple enrollment types.
The projected configuration would be as follows:
Use Directory Sync with Active Directory using 2 different security groupsEnrollment Session Group - As user group session participants are added to the group before thescheduled session and emailed a link to complete enrollment.All Employees Group - synchronize all users usernames without phone numbers.

Is there a method to run the Duo for OWA installation agent via script? So I can write something in powershell with the iKey, sKey, API host already baked in, so that the script can be run on all CAS nodes after each CU installation?
Even better yet, any chance if the issue can be fixed entirely by Duo, so that it’s no longer necessary to remove/reinstall Duo agent after Exchange CU installation?

In my VDI environment, I just need to configure Duo on the Connection Server portion as per the guide.
I do not need to install the Duo agent on my VDI desktops. Is that a correct statement?

I am trying to use Duo to add 2FA to our wifi access. I have two Cisco WAP121s set up with NPS, and it works without Duo in the mix. Authentication type is PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2.
When I add the Duo proxy in between, I get messages in the NPS event log saying “Network Policy Server granted access to a user” - but the Duo proxy thinks NPS is returning a challenge. Duo then sends the challenge back to the AP, gets a valid response back, forwards it back to NPS - and then thinks it is recieving another challenge (nothing appears in the NPS log for this second request).
Things then get stuck in a loop for perhaps 5-15 iterations before the NPS server does something different, and the loop ends with a reject. Remember only one entry appears in the NPS server event log for all of this, apparenlty granting access to the user.
Below is a representative section from the Duo auth proxy log. You can see things get stuck in a loop for 10 iterations here.
Anyone got any clue what could be happening here?
Thanks,
Phil

Duo Administrator passwords now validated for domain-specific strings
Enhanced the security requirements for Duo administrator passwords. Passwords cannot include terms from an administrators name, email address, company name, nor the words “Duo” or “Security”.
Enhanced the security requirements for Duo administrator passwords. Passwords cannot include terms from an administrators name, email address, company name, nor the words “Duo” or “Security”.
Improved Android Trusted Mobile Endpoints workflow
We have taken new measures to further secure the Trusted Endpoints mobile workflow on Android by no longer using an always-running clipboard service for users authenticating via a WebView (from another app, like Namely). In exchange for better security, users will have to open the Duo Mobile app to start the call out to Duo to see if a device is managed. Then, If the check is successful, Duo Mobile will tell the user to switch back to the calling app.The regular use case whereby users are authenticating from a mobile browser (to something like the DAG) will not be altered to tell the user to switch apps. That will continue to function as it does currently.

I was wondering if I could have some feedback/suggestions here,
I am in the process of deploying Duo to a client of ours for terminal server access.
To this end I have enabled AD sync between the DC on premise and Duo’s portal.
I have two AD security groups, one for requires 2FA which will have 21 users in it, and the rest of the users are in the Bypass 2FA group (approx 80 users).
I have tested, and this is working fine with the Bypass 2FA settings against the Bypass 2FA Security group, and requires 2FA against the Requires 2FA group.
My only problem with this is that the client will be billed for approx 100 user licenses when we only want to subject 21 users to 2FA, I understand that the licensing is done per user whether they are enrolled or not or subject to 2FA.
The ideal scenario is just to have the 21 users in the portal requiring 2FA, with Duo ignoring all users users and allowing them to login/auth without 2FA prompt.
Any ideas how I can achieve this or does Duo need to have all the other bypass 2FA users synced to its portal too?

Is this correct or can it be configured this way? I’m using the Duo Access Gateway as the SAML provider.
I would like to use DNG but I only have one external IP so with simple port forwarding 80/443 to the DNG I could only expose one host.
So can DNG proxy requests to the SAML provider and only require one IP for port forwarding or has anyone configured DNG and DAG behind another proxy system to work behind only one IP?",0

Steve explains the biometric authentication system as a triad of hardware, platform, and open standards. While the first two have been defined and addressed by the industry, open standards have been the missing gap. WebAuthn is a browser-based API allowing for web apps to create strong, public key-based credentials for the purpose of user auth, filling that gap.

We have deployed the Duo Access Gateway (DAG) in our organization to fulfil the role of providing access for our users as a Self-Service Portal to manage their devices. One of the issues we’ve run into is attempting to craft a policy that performs the following functionality:
External Access - Deny unenrolled users from enrolling their device(s) from outside our secure corporate network(s), yet allow enrolled users to be prompted for 2FA to manage changes to their Duo profile when accessing the Self-Service Portal once authenticated.Internal Access - Allow unenrolled and enrolled users to enroll and/or manage device(s) whilst connected to our secure corporate network(s) when accessing the Self-Service Portal once authenticated…
External Access - Deny unenrolled users from enrolling their device(s) from outside our secure corporate network(s), yet allow enrolled users to be prompted for 2FA to manage changes to their Duo profile when accessing the Self-Service Portal once authenticated.
Internal Access - Allow unenrolled and enrolled users to enroll and/or manage device(s) whilst connected to our secure corporate network(s) when accessing the Self-Service Portal once authenticated…
Thus far, the policies I’ve crafted either blocks all enrollment access from internal or external sources, or allows enrollment from all sources. The concern is worst case scenario a users credentials are compromised, and used by the unknown third party to enroll devices under the aforementioned users credentials without their knowledge or ours. The policies follow:
Device Mgmt Portal Policy - Deny External Enrollment
This policy applies to: Device Management Portal (for Duo - Test1, Duo - Test2).
Enabled New User Policy Deny access to unenrolled users.Enabled Group Access Policy No effect.Enabled Remembered Devices Do not remember devices.
Device Mgmt Portal - Internal Enrollment
This policy applies to: Device Management Portal (for Duo - Test1, Duo - Test2).
Enabled New User Policy Prompt unenrolled users to enroll whenever possible.Enabled Group Access Policy No effect.Enabled Remembered Devices Do not remember devices.Enabled Authorized Networks Require 2FA for these networks: Specific Internal/External Network(s).
If anyone has suggestions or a sample of how they have their policy(ies) configured sans any sensitive information contained therein, I would appreciate sharing the knowledge. Or if this is something that currently is unavailable, but may be a future feature request, I’ll take that as well.
Thanks.

Miscellaneous changes
Certain Duo APIs previously accepted requests with Content-Type headers other than the values specified in our documentation. Duo changed this as part of internationalization efforts and security improvements. If an API request fails with the error 40106 (Invalid content type in request) please consult the API documentation for the correct Content-Type header. For example, POST requests to the Auth API must use “Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded” and APIs that do not expect JSON bodies cannot be used with an application/json Content-Type.Trusted Endpoints Management Systems in the Duo Admin Panel may now be renamed.Endpoints in the Duo Admin Panel can be filtered by new software statuses: Latest, Up-to-date, Out-of-Date, and End-of-Life.All timestamps and time columns in the Duo Admin Panel now respect the timezone preference setting.

We are trying to use Duo with our VMware Horizon View system.
Our users login with their UPN, always in the email address format.Our DUO account only has the users’ CN.
So, following the auth proxy docs, I configured theusername_attributeto be the “sAMAccountName” andat_attributefield to be UPN.
Users authenticate to AD via the proxy, but it ALWAYS sends the UPN to Duo. It seems to be a bug, ignoring the “username_attribute” entry.
NOTE - Our UPN and CNs are different. Ex. “jdoe@—.---” and “jdo123”.

Since biometrics a) can not be changed and b) the quality of the implementation also varies wildy (and has been demonstrated to be breakable with little effort) claiming that for example a shoddy finger print implementation is MORE SECURE than a let’s say 6 digit PIN is just false.
I concede that biometrics may be a good solution for some demographics - especially when the alternative is NO AUTHENTICATION - but again this is about biometrics vs PIN codes.

I have an application that uses SAML to authenticate the user with Azure directory.  A conditional rule is then used to trigger Duo 2FA.  Then in my Duo portal I have a policy for the Microsoft Azure AD application which does not require trusted device, and allows SMS.  Despite this, on mobile devices it ALWAYS asks the user to verify they have Duo mobile installed (or prompts for a local certificate if they happen to have one), despite that trusted device isn’t reqiured.  The user can click the “I do not have Duo Mobile” and it lets them in.  Therefore, the check is trivial / theatrical.  Also, the SMS option does not show up.
Is this behavior typical?  Is it a bug?  Or is there something in the JSON file for custom control that is saved on the Azure end which needs to be changed to support this?
Sadly, the only fix is to disable Duo Mobile as a trusted endpoint configuration (as well as delete the local cert if you have one on your mobile device).  Only then will the 2FA prompt come up offering the user a choice to push or code (still no SMS).  This really feels like a serious BUG to me…",0

We’re running an integration with Duo in our app, we’re using SFAuthenticationSession to connect to an Okta endpoint and kick-off the SSO procedure which eventually leads to a two factor authentication challenge powered by Duo.
The process works fine when receiving the push notification, opening it (by sliding down on it, or by force pushing on it) and hitting Approve, but we are having a problem if we leave our application, go to the Duo app, approve the push notification within the Duo app, and then come back to our app.
When we come back to our app, we see the “Your session has expired. Please try again.” message, even though we had just approved the push notification. I’ve attached a screenshot.
Do you have any guidance around this? Is this something you have seen previously? Maybe a known issue? Or maybe this is just the way things are supposed to work and we are doing something wrong?
For what it’s worth, this seems to be related to the app being backgrounded and then being re-opened, as when the app is not backgrounded and the push notification is approved by sliding down on the notification (or force push), the authentication process works fine.
If, for example, we were to have the Duo biometric validation installed as well (I believe through Duo Access or Duo Beyond), we would always have to leave the app and come back, so I’m wondering how the login procedure should be implemented so that our session doesn’t expire when reopening the app.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you!

Duo Admin Panel minimum password length increase
For new Duo account signups, the minimum password length is now 12 characters.This change will not affect existing customers. Saving theSettings page in the Duo Admin Panelwill preserve your current password setting, even if it is lower than 12. New Duo Administrators created in an existing account with a lower minimum character setting only need to satisfy the lower minimum character setting that has already been configured.If an admin on the account changes the minimum password setting length, they may change it incrementally up to 12 characters (such as 6 to 7 or 8 to 10). Once it is increased to an “incremental” value, it cannot be decreased below that value.

Beginning in late July, Azure Active Directory Premium P1 customers will be able to integrate with Duo.
Last fall, we announced our integration with Azure AD, helping customers move away from Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS). Our customers are federating access to Office 365 via Azure AD while using Duo to enforce policy controls. When first announced in 2017, Microsoft limited Duo’s integration to the highest tier of Azure AD: Premium P2. But with the opening up of this offering to Premium P1, many more organizations can take advantage of our Azure AD integration.

I appreciate the notice and transparency, but I gotta say I’m disappointed, Duo. The PCI SSC announced this requirement over a year and a half ago, and the deadline (which was already extended a year) for implementation was June 30, 2018. A security company I use and trust is just now implementing this on July 26, 2018 (being out of compliance for almost a month)? Those of us who take PCI seriously know how much effort and preparation may have been required for this, and the LONG time the council gave us to implement it. Don’t get me wrong, we absolutely love Duo and I will whole-heartedly recommend it over your competitors, but just some feedback that we’re disappointed in your lack of preparation and commitment to PCI. When your job is to help me be compliant (primarily section 8.3) and you yourself aren’t (section 4.1), it’s not sending a good message.",1

The Payment Cards Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) recommends TLS 1.2 for all merchants who can collect credit card billing information. Because the Duo Admin Panel can be used for credit card billing, we have decided to adopt this requirement.
This change is not end-user facing; it will only affect Duo administrators accessing the Admin Panel on outdated browsers that do not support TLS 1.2. The newest versions of the most popular browsers all support TLS 1.2 by default. If you are concerned about compatibility, please update your browser or check your browser’s SSL implementation here:https://www.ssllabs.com.

When connecting from an external source, I am consistently getting 4 DUO replies for the one login session. Eventually, the client errors out with a mismatched configuration between the client and VPN server. If I remove DUO from the equation, it works perfectly.
Has anyone had any experience like this? I’ve been thru the RRAS server but I don’t see where the issue may be located and at this point, I’m at a loss.

We’re in the process of rolling out DUO to all of our internal apps at work - and since I was using the API so much I wrote this library in my spare time to make it a bit easier.
It’s a .NET Standard library that wraps an HttpClient object and provides methods and response deserialization for all of the Auth API endpoints.

Kyle Lady of Duo Labs states:
“For most Android devices, users are at the mercy of their mobile carriers to provide updates. In turn, carriers have to wait for device manufacturers to provide updated software for each model they produce. The platform fragmentation of Android provides great flexibility for manufacturers, but with that upside comes the downside of a substantial overhead to produce updates for the combination of every model and every carrier.""

We are experiencing some odd slowness issues with our LDAP Proxy Server. When using a main  Application that get’s used a lot with LDAP here at our school, normal login was under 2 seconds. When we  changed the Application to use the Duo Proxy LDAP Server, we saw that it would take up to 35 seconds before we would see the push on our phone. Not only does it do it with the phone, but same when logging in with a hardware token, and phone call. After doing the 2nd form of authentication, it logs us in right away.  At other times, we have seen it go as quickly as 1-5 seconds. The Server that is running the LDAP Proxy Server is on the quickest hardware we own, so we know it’s not hardware related.
Are plan for now is add a 2nd Proxy server and do some load balancing, but we were unsure if that will really help or not.
The Server that is running the LDAP Proxy is Windows Server 2016, with 4GB of RAM, and 2 core, on flash memory.

Recently we implemented both Duo Auth for RDWeb and RD Gateway successfully. One thing we have noticed is that users that connect to the desktop via Remote Resources (the RDWeb aspx link) on the official Android/Apple Remote Desktop apps can no longer connect. The app is stating that the Web Feed URL is now not valid despite it working prior to the Duo Auth being installed.
As a temporary fix, I have discovered that logging into RDWeb via phone browser and opening the RDP file via the app seems to work as a one time instance but the moment I try to re-launch it stops working.
Has anyone experienced this or knows which of the two applications is likely to be causing it?

I am currently trialling Duo for my company and so far we like the product. One issue I am struggling with is certificates.
We have the Microsoft RDP client installed and working nicely 2FA’ing test users via push notifications on their iPhones. We have a feature on our Firewall to enable SSL deep packet inspection which has just been enabled (description below)
When full SSL inspection is used, the FortiGate impersonates the recipient of the originating SSL session, then decrypts and inspects the content. The FortiGate then re-encrypts the content, creates a new SSL session between the FortiGate and the recipient by impersonating the sender, and sends the content to the sender.
With this enabled, when the push notification is sent to an iPhone (on the WiFi)  using the deep packet policy, the error ‘Invalid Certificate, The Certificate provided is invalid’ displays on the iPhone. I can bypass URLs for this feature of our firewall - What URLs should I white-list? I have tried white listing *.duosecurity.com but this doesn’t work and am not sure what URLs are used for incoming push notifications on the certificate.
Any suggestions on what URL I should be exempting?",0

DNG is 3 containers -  admin, portal, and a redis container. The admin was the easy one, that’s the site where the config is done, I ended up pointing redis at an AWS elasticache because the .rdb file was being overwritten every time I re-launched a new pod, that leads me to my final problem.

Brainstorming here…
Deploying Duo to many Mac and Linux systems.  There is pervasive use of SSH in the environment, much of it automated by using SSH keys as one would expect.
I would treat the keys as “untrusted” since they are currently completely user managed.  Switching to trusted auth, I’d use AD as the first factor, and Duo as the second.  This ensures a quick cleanup of a newly departing user without having to go back and sweep up keys.
The issue with this is that it pretty much breaks automation.
What are folks doing (outside of kerberos) to make SSH behave sort of like an SSO login?  What I’d like to see is a capability to log in with AD/Duo once and have that session live for x number of hours before requiring re-authentication.  This I think would be a good middle ground to support automation within reason and still keep it manageable from a security/risk perspective.",0

This update will feature changes to the appearance of the account list; specific details are provided later in this post.
As we progress through these changes, our goal is to make Duo Mobile easier to use and understand for both first-time users with a single account and expert users with many accounts. We are modernizing both the front and backend of Duo Mobile to better align with mobile OS design standards and to better support new OS features.
All of the upcoming design changes have been tested and validated through usability testing and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from real users. Later this year we will introduce an early-access beta testing program for Duo Mobile where you can test the latest changes before we publicly release them via the normal app update process.
We are committed to providing Duo Admins advance notice of changes to our app and services. For changes that do not affect workflows, we will provide a minimum of 2 weeks of notice via ourcommunity forum(where you are reading this right now!). You can subscribe to notifications for new release notes by following theprocess described here. For larger changes to workflows or major new features, we will provide a minimum of 1 month notice via email to Duo Admins.
Going forward, Duo Mobile will be updating more frequently, much like many of the other business apps you use everyday.
As stated above, the changes in Duo Mobile version 3.21.0 for iOS and Android focus on improvements to the main account list screen. Key highlights are as follows:

I’m going through a PCI 3.2 certification process, where the MFA process has changed.
According to PCI 3.2 the MFA should now respect some points such as:
The authentication mechanisms used for MFA should be independent of one another such that access to a factor does not grant access to any other factor, and the compromise of any one factor does not affect the integrity or confidentiality of any other factor.PCI DSS requires that all factors in multi-factor authentication be verified prior to the authentication. (Which is not happening in my case, first it opens the logon screen, however, when the user misses the password, Windows returns the screen again asking for the correct password, thus allowing a try and error case)

Moreover, no prior knowledge of the success or failure of anyfactor should be provided to the individual until all factors have been presented. (Again my problem repeats itself.)
Could anyone tell me if there is a way to configure the DUO for this type of operation?
From what I read, the tool is fully compliant with PCI DSS 3.2, but I have not seen this in practice.
I count on your cooperation.

Customers can now utilize SAML Identity Providers (IdP) like Azure AD, ADFS, Duo Access Gateway, etc. to federate access to the Duo Admin Panel.
In order to support this feature, we are also making an update toadmin.duo.com- a persistent Single Sign On button similar to what you’ve seen on other cloud applications.
Screen Shot 2018-04-27 at 12.25.41 PM.jpg486×870 48.2 KB
We also would like to take a moment to thank our beta customers for their feedback and input throughout the process.
Documentation around the new feature can be foundhere.
What SAML IdPs are supported?ADFS, Azure AD, Duo Access Gateway, Google, Okta, OneLogin, PingOne, PingFederate, and Shibboleth.In addition, we support the utilization of Custom SAML IdPs.
Why are administrators with single sign-on required to complete MFA?We require multifactor authentication for all logins to the administrative panel because we consider it to be a critical application.
If Duo is already integrated with your Identity Provider (IdP), such as ADFS or Okta, this can result in a scenario where administrators will complete MFA once with the IdP and then a second time directly with the administrative panel.
While we understand this may be an inconvenience, we will continue to require MFA for all administrative panel access.",1

Two of the production servers are configured with a Kemp Load Master load balancer.  One of the servers is in our DR facility and not load balanced.
We have installed duo on the one DR server for testing purposes.  When testing we do not get prompted for a duo.  We are going to OWA viahttps://127.0.0.1/owa, but do not get the prompt upon login.  We are then logged into the mailbox.
This Exchange server in our DR location does not have any active databases, just passive copies.  Not sure if that has anything to do with this.
I turned on debug mode, and see some events stating:  “User is not authenticated; resource not protected”Authentication not required
Lastly, and good documentation out there for configuring OWA with Kemp Load Master load balancers?

My bosses have given me a series of requirements: Get Nextcloud installed into our network, and integrate Duo onto it. We have individuals we occasionally contract out into SCIFs so Duo needs to play with the hardware tokens as an option for those that can’t push to their phone for 2FA.
Some people may suggest using another platform in either department. My company is insisting on needing Nextcloud. It is a solution for large data transfers (to large for email) between our contracting companies that doesn’t require them needing accounts into our network. Duo is something we are to far invested into at this point to just start buying some other companies hardware tokens or to just swap 2FA providers. My company choose to go with them to meet 2FA for NIST reasons prior to me being employed and has it integrated in nearly everything at this point as well as purchasing their hardware tokens…
My current setup is the Duo LDAPS Proxy which is working great except for 1 small factor. I log into Nextcloud with my Active Directory (AD) account which is configured to push to my DUO LDAP proxy. The Proxy authenticates to the Active Directory and if accepted, pushes to Duo for a auto-push or hardware token acceptance if the password had the delimiter. When user accepts (or if hardware token is correct) duo accepts and sends back to proxy which sends back to Nextcloud.
This is all functioning correctly. The 1 small factor is that after I log in, it apparently periodically re-requests authorization. So I will be working within Nextcloud and all the sudden get a prompt for Duo from the LDAP proxy. It will not load the file/page until I accept. This leads me to believe that nextcloud is resending authorization packets periodically which triggers the whole authentication process again, and since the user has no option to add a delimiter on the auto authentication, it auto-pushes to the phone. Which is an issue for SCIF people. They can’t re-authenticate and therefore will be kicked off.
Is there any way of configuring Duo to not push when Nextcloud sends the LDAP re-authorization until the user logs off or for XX minutes? I see that it can be done for web browsers if DUO played with Nextcloud (which i cant get it to hence the LDAP proxy route). Or is there a way to use the LDAP proxy for initial login and the actual AD for re-authentication requests?

We are currently using Duo Authentication for Windows Logon for RDP access to some machines and it’s working great!  We are now considering enabling Duo 2FA for console logon too.  It seems, however, that when console 2FA is enabled it also kicks in when unlocking your computer after the screen saver kicks (we require a password after screen lock).  Is there a way to force 2FA on initial logon but not on screen lock?

When I try to connect the message on the client says:
“The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server. Specifically, the authentication method used by the server to verify your username and password may not match the authentication method configured in your connection profile.”
Although this message is indeed very specific, I think it may not be describing the actual problem. I have the authentication set to only PAP at both ends.
Perhaps someone can help me interpret the following from authproxy.log on the server?

Customer had hosted O365 webmail in Okta. We had integrated Duo with Okta to have MFA enabled for O365. The concern raised was that external userstrying to access the webmail from outside were prompted thrice for authentication (Okta->Duo->O365) this was a pain point for the customer. So we were looking for an alternative solution.
Current Use Case :We found that Duo has the capability to integrate with ADFS directly to protect Browser based federated logins like O365.We are in the process of getting this POC executed.Customer wants to make sure that he will not have to authenticate with Duo to access his mailbox through Outlook. He should only have to authenticate with Duo if he tries to access his mailbox with OWA. This is mainly for Users accessing from external devices. Can you kindly share your inputs on this?

I installed the DUO application on a Windows Server 2012R2 server (physical machine), enabled only for RDP connections. When I attempt to RDP into the server I get the following error “Bad Request Timestamp () [40105 Error]”. The network I am testing in is not in a domain, but in a workgroup. Here are the steps that I have taken so far:
Ensured I has .NET 4.5 installed.
Made sure time settings (NTP) were all good.
Checked to make sure Windows Firewall and any other security software(s) were not blocking traffic between DUO and my network.
Ensured the server has connection outside of the internal network.5, Also double checked username on the machine, to make sure it matched what is in DUO.
Has anyone else encountered this issue? If so, how did you resolve the issue?

I was wondering if Duo for RDP mititgates any risk from CredSSP Flaw in Remote Desktop Protocol (CVE-2018-0886). The Microsoft fix requires both the server and the client to have the update installed. That update is responsible for messing up NICs on Windows 7 and 2008R2 machines (KB4088875/KB4088878). If Duo mitigates this vulnerability, it give MS some time to get their things together, and for clients to update the person devices.

I know that the VPN is using the proxy as if I stop it and attempt a look up from the firewall it fails.
If I enter incorrect user credentials the VPN errors. If I enter the correct credentials the user is validated and the VPN connects without DUO.
I have tried putting Exempt_primary_bind=false in the config and it doesn’t work at all.
If anyone could offer any pointers that would be great!

My company is planning to rollout Office 365 with Duo 2FA and once activated, macOS Mail.app can no longer access Office 365 Exchange online because it doesn’t support oauth2. If we would be using Microsoft Azure 2FA the we could create an application specific password to allow mail.app to access Office 365 (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_exchon/accessing-exchange-365-account-with-apple-mail-app/9c78109e-77da-4491-a1e4-8ca62b5a6095). However, this option does not exist in our Office 365 settings because we are using Duo 2FA.
Do our Macintosh users have to wait for Apple to add oauth2 to mail.app like they did with iOS 11 mail or is there a trick in Duo to allow Macintosh users to use the macOS mail.app with Office 365 Exchange and Duo 2FA?

So a few questions about the enrollment email.If a user is added by directory sync in oct they are sent an activation email. User does nothing to that email. Does Duo continuously send him updated enrollment emails as a forced or scheduled sync occurs with the option enabled to send enrollment messages?
I fear its one and done. Meaning when the user is added initially they are send the enrollment email. The system only sends the enrollment email automatically if they are “new” to the users.
If that’s the case what happens to the user if they are never enrolled?Is it on us to remove them from the AD group to keep our user count down? Or is there a report of users that have not enrolled I can run and remove them from our group?

They are currently exploring the option of configuring Duo’s Access Gateway to leverage the ability of Duo to provide two factor authentication while acting as a SAML IdP.
The customer also wants to configure Duo as a single factor authentication (ie., Call/SMS/Push only) without having an Authentication Server back-end (LDAP/AD etc) configured in the Duo Access Gateway. To give a better picture, consider the following flow:
The Setup suggested by Duo in the following page is as follows:
https://duo.com/docs/dag
A SAML SP (our product) --> Duo Access Gateway (sitting at customer’s end) --> Authentication Server + Call/SMS/Push withduo.comwebsite
The setup they (our customer) likes to have, is as follows:
A SAML SP (our product) --> Duo Access Gateway (sitting at customer’s end) --> Call/SMS/Push withduo.comwebsite
In brief, they would like to just fetch the username from the SAML Request, and then use that to have a single factor authentication using Call/Push/SMS, which successfully completes the SAML flow if all goes well, and returns back to the SP with SAML Response
Is it possible to configure Duo’s Access Gateway to work without back-end authentication server, and just pass the user to Call/Push/SMS page?

Those include international and military organizations, Ministry of Defenses, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intelligence units and defense contractors that provide IT services and engineering/robotics design for the U.S. government.

We’ve been rather aggressive in our adoption of BeyondCorp,with the help of Duo and their epic Network Gateway, and for the most part, it all just works as you’d expect. However, Confluence is being a bit weird and I’ve a sneaky feeling it has to do with too many moving parts and DNG and hoping someone else here has solved this, or possibly knows how.
The setup:
Duo Network Gateway (DNG)Microsoft ADFSDuo MobileUbuntu box running Atlassian Confluence 6.2Apache24 with modproxy
Duo Network Gateway (DNG)
Microsoft ADFS
Duo Mobile
Ubuntu box running Atlassian Confluence 6.2
Apache24 with modproxy
For most things, it works. User visitshttps://conf.whee.comand they get redirected to our ADFS, where they use their corp domain creds, then have to deal with duo mfa for the final step. If all is good, their device is healthy and in a set geographic location, they are presented with the login page for Confluence.
Once auth’d, they can do most things confluence, except some bits like removing spaces and pages. Here is where I think the numerous proxies are actually causing issues. When you try and do any of those commands, you get a spinning wheel of death and a 403

for everything else, it functions as i’d expect it to. So usual fault finding approach has seen me:
1: ensure the traffic is being proxied as it should do. In this case, yes as i can create content and do what one does when using confluence.2: are the required ports listening? yes, all is there and redirected where needed.

So is the REST issue being hit by DNG not forwarding right from the browser, or is it something closer to the source? Has anyone else deployed Confluence this way?
I’ve hit a brick wall here, so any help in putting me out of my misery would be so amazing right now.

We have configured Duo and the Sonicwall with a radius domain, and have setup the Duo proxy authenticator.  This part tested successfully.
Here is our issue… we restrict VPN access based on Active Directory groups.  We also restrict what servers/applications people have access to based on AD groups and Sonicwall policies as well.
We are now seeing this setup does not apply the AD groups.
Is there any way to get our AD groups to apply within the radius/duo setup?  We were told to setup LDAP application in duo for the Sonicwall and duo, but that does not seem to resolve this issue.
Any other suggestions out there?
I am starting to think rather than using the Duo Proxy authenticator we need to have “real” radius server in our AD environment.  Is this the only solution to our issue?

“This Duo proxy server also acts as a RADIUS server — there’s no need to deploy a separate RADIUS server to use Duo.”
How???
Maybe I overlooked something but the instructions on that page show how to use Duo with an external AD or RADIUS server. How can I make the Duo proxy server also acts as a RADIUS server?
Basically, have the Sophos UTM still handle authentication but also require Duo push in order to login to the user portal, web admin and SSL VPN.
UPDATE:Now I realize why I can’t do what I want. Sophos only has the following options for user authentication: Local, None and Remote.
Tell me if I’m wrong… Someone should probably remove that line I quoted from the Duo doc or add more details. That statement led me to waste time figuring out that, ""yes, I can use Duo proxy without a separate RADIUS server, but both Sophos and Duo authenticate users without need of a password.",1

[SOLVED] | Duo Restore forum,,GwynethLlewelyn,https://community.duo.com/u/GwynethLlewelyn,12/6/2017,"Hi there! I use Duo Security as a 2FA single-use password generator forCloudflare. It has worked flawlessly ever since I’ve configured it… until today I upgraded my iPhone to a more recent model. After restoring everything from the backups, and while the Duo application correctly identifies that I use it for Cloudflare, since the original configuration was tied to the older iPhone, the new one requires anewconfirmation/registration.
But CloudFlare, to allow any changes/modifications of the 2FA device/system that is tied to the account, needs some extra authentication… from the original device/system used to set it up on the first place… which sort of makes sense… unless, of course, you don’t have it any more!
Other applications give alternative options to ‘reset’ the 2FA system in use, such as providing a QR code to scan, or a special sequence of numbers to reset the app used to generate the single-use code combination — or even, such as in the case of those applications using Duo Prompt (such as WordPress), you can even use the Duo Restore feature (which works like a charm in WordPress!).
But sadly Cloudflare doesn’t haveanysuch choice on their backoffice!.. theonlyoption is to authenticate with theexistingDuo app andthenremove it to set up with a new one. It doesn’t even allow changing, say, to a competitor, and back again; once that session is expired, there is no way to get back in. That’s an egg-and-chicken problem: to change the ‘Get Working’ message on the Duo app, I need to reset CloudFlare’s ‘link’ to Duo Security; but to do so, I need to have theoldapp on theoldiPhone working (which, of course, it isn’t; the iPhone was already factory-reset and sent to another person…).
So, is there an alternative way to I ‘force’ the ‘Get Working’ message on the Duo Mobile app to actuallyworkagain with Cloudflare?
(And before you ask, yes, I’ve also asked the very same question on Duo’s own Discourse boards — before I get pushed and bumped from one board to the otheri.e. ‘That’s a Duo issue, talk to them’ vs ‘That’s a Cloudflare issue, talk to them’)",0

Duo coordinated with AWS’s security team to disclose the gaps found in an AWS tutorial on enabling users to configure their own credentials and MFA settings.

This conflicts with their setup instructionshere.
We’ve been using Duo for SSO for a while; I’ve always had to login to my org before I could use my Salesforce login to access connected apps, the community, etc. Kind of annoying, but workable. If users don’t do things in this order, we get a 404 error. (this applies to connected apps, etc.)
I started noticing problems after Salesforce’s Winter release. I had issues logging into my ETL tool and finally had to uncheck our saved custom domain to get in. Our vendor uses OKTA and couldn’t reproduc the issue. The found the link above and suggested I give this change a shot. I’m looking for advice whether I should since it doesn’t follow the Salesforce SSO setup instructions on the Duo site.
I’ve also had issues opening community links and receiving the 404 error while I was already logged into my production org. The only way to get back in is to refresh my org browser page, which if I’m remote will trigger 2FA once I send the push, I can usually open community links once again.",0

To enable this, Duo Beyond edition customers can select the “Duo Mobile” Management Tools Integration in the “Trusted Endpoints Configuration” tab of the Duo Admin Panel.Duo Mobile MTI.png1844×706 69.6 KB
With this feature enabled, Duo verifies that a 2FA device has an activated Duo Mobile account and that the device is compliant with all of the administrator’s policies even if the device is only used for access.

I’m looking for a way to find out how to configure a second factor as U2F Token using GlobalProtect of Palo Alto Networks.
First of all, I’d tested it with passcode as a second factor provided by DUO, and it worked well.(Local authentication first, and authenticated by passcode)
However, I don’t have any U2F Token, so I didn’t test with it.
When I was using passcode, I put  <radius_server_duo_only>'s attributes, such as ikey, skey, api_host, radius_ip, and radius_secrect.
I want to know that is there any changes in the ‘authproxy’ file for using U2F Token.
If someone tested with U2F Token before, would you help me to figure out how to do it?
or just tell me there’s no need to be changed any configuration of the file.
I’m looking forward the answer.",0

I’m followingYubiKeys | Duo Security. It works on the Yubico website if I upload the config to Yubico. I’ve regenerated a half-dozen times or more with no luck.
I even tried configuring as 6-digit HOTP and it didn’t work. In 6-digit HOTP mode I noticed it emits lots more than 6 digits (I believe it is sending the public and/or private identifier before the 6-digit code). I had it put three codes into my text editor, stripped all but the last 6 digits from them and successfully resynced the token, so it looks like it works for anything but logging in. (I tried the 6 digit trick for logging in, too - no luck).
I can’t tell if the Yubikey OTP mode generates too many characters - I don’t know what Duo is expecting.
Any ideas?

We are using duo_unix-1.9.19-0.x86_64.rpm together with Centrify authentication on Red Hat Linux 6.7.
You can see we are doing Centrify authentication first, then DUO authentication:
#%PAM-1.0auth    required        pam_env.soauth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_centrifydc.soauth    sufficient      pam_duo.soauth    requisite       pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet_successauth    required        pam_deny.so
Now we encountered one problem.
We have some special users whose unixname mapped in Centrify is different from their Active Directory canonical name (samAccountName).Those special users can’t pass through DUO authentication with either name, because both will be converted as their unixname and sent to Duo for verification. Since they registered their AD account on Duo, both will fail.
For example, for user “Binello Sev”:
We tried both:ssh sev@mytestmachinessh binello@mytestmachine
Neither is working, because both will be converted as “binello” and sent to Duo for verification. Since he registered his Active Directory account (sev) on Duo, both will fail.
We are wondering if there is a configuration parameter than can be provided so that the DUO module will forward the samAccountName when authenticating to the DUO server?

We would like to add security to our unix server for direct access (ssh), web access and email. I have already set things up for ssh and have some confidence that there is a path forward for web pages, but am unclear on how to proceed for our postfix email server. It would be nice if MUAs connecting via imap/pop would periodically (daily?) require a duo checkin. Looking at this site I’m wondering if something similar could be done using an imap proxy server:

I’m using pam_duo to add two-factor auth to SSH and sudo on my VPS running Ubuntu 14.04.5. I host a couple of websites on the server, and I want my users to be able to manage their files via SFTP without enrolling in Duo. I don’t want to give my users full SSH/shell access to the server if at all possible.
I have installed pam_duo according to the guide on the Duo website (https://duo.com/docs/duounix), and SSH/sudo two-factor is working great, but I’m having trouble excluding the SFTP users from Duo. All SFTP users are in their own sftpusers group, and I set the groups option in pam_duo.conf as follows per the suggestion from this community post:DUO Unix - only for SSH login (not for sftp, etc.)
groups = *,!sftpusers
I have also tried:
groups = !sftpusers,*
This seemed to work, but in both cases the system is now accepting anything as a valid password for an SFTP user. If I comment out the groups setting, SFTP users are denied access even with the correct password.
Everything works properly if I remove pam_duo from the system.
I’m not sure how to continue troubleshooting. Can anyone offer guidance on how to force Duo on SSH/sudo users, but bypass for the SFTP users?

Before setting up Duo auth, I used standard LDAP authentication, which allowed me to add an additional field (mail) for use with SSO logins to Citrix Sharefile.  Sharefile uses email instead of usernames for SSO login, so you can either have users log in with their email address, or you can use standard username and pass an additional LDAP attribute (mail) for SSO.  I was able to successfully set up SSO into Sharefile from the UG portal using basic LDAP authentication on the Netscaler.  Once I enabled Duo authentication, however, this ceased to work.  I realized that it was likely because the mail attribute was no longer being passed.  Reading some of the various setup guides I saw a parameter pass_through_all=true that I have added to my radius_server_iframe and _auto sections of my authproxy.cfg file to no avail.  Is there a way to pass that particular LDAP attribute using Duo login?",0

Federal agencies and contractors use NIST’s standards as guidelines on how to secure digital identities.
In 2003, NIST manager Bill Burr made up the now-infamous “best practices” for passwords, including complexity with regard to special characters, capitalization, numerals, and so on. He recently admitted he regretted doing so to The Wall Street Journal - as his suggestions only increased user frustration while having little effect on security. The new NIST guidelines recommend using long passphrases instead of complex passwords.

We have purchased some Dell N2048P switches and I am in the process of setting them up.  I have setup radius within the duo web portal for 2FA and the push to my phone with the DUO app works fine and I get logged into the switch.  I am using [radius_server_auto] in the authproxy.cfg with client=ad_client.  My questions are:
What line of code do I need to use on these switches to put myself in the Privileged EXEC mode when logging in?  I am having to type my local enable password after I get connected.  I have asked Dell Support about this and they say this is a function of the Radius server itself that allows this to happen.  I am guessing that I maybe add something to the authproxy.cfg to make this happen?  Their actual quote is:
The rest of the configuration will need to be done on the RADIUS side, in this case Duo Security. With enable authentication set to RADIUS, as soon as the command enable is issued on the switch, it will then try to authenticate via the RADIUS server. If the RADIUS server is not configured to handle the enable scenario, then you will not be authenticated. I suggest contacting Duo Security, to see if they are able to accommodate enable authentication.
Logging into into the web interface, I get prompted with the 2FA and I am able to get logged in.  However I get a prompt upon logon that says “Please note that you are a level 1 user and do not have configuration privileges.  This session is limited to read-only operations.”  Any help with this will be appreciated!",0

I’m deploying Duo RDP to protect some of our servers. We have servers in multiple domains, but user accounts share same username (e.g. MYCOMPANY\johndoe, MYCOMPANYTEST\johndoe, MYCOMPANYEXT\johndoe) etc. I was hoping to set UPN suffixes for johndoe accounts across the domains to the the same value (e.g.johndoe@corp.mycompany.com) and use only one Duo account to manage all servers.
However, it appears that Duo RDP software doesn’t use UPN and automatically prepends NetBIOS domain name to username, so requests to API look like “POST■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■:443/auth/v2/preauth?ipaddr=127.0.0.1&username=MYCOMPANYTEST\johndoe” Naturally if my Duo username is MYCOMPANY\johndoe, this will fail due to username mismatch as I’m trying to log into TEST domain.
My question is – is there a way to modify this and make it submit UPN name or just username? Alternatively - can we assign an alias or a secondary username to a Duo account? Would you suggest another approach to using one Duo account to manage servers in multiple domains?
Thank you very much for your input!",0

My primary authenticator is a openldap server:

it is unclear to me what cert(s) is(are) needed for ssl_cert_path and the private key ssl_key_path.
we have an Offline Root CA and two Sub Issuing CAs. i have these 3 certs in a single PEM file, and it is used for the [ad_client] section ssl_ca_certs_file=conf\SSL_Certs.pem. In the [ad_client] section i have transport=ldaps and port=363, and it works fine.
but i am confused what cert needs to go in the [ldap_server_auto] section. Can someone please help me with this? the Authentication Proxy Reference guide doesn’t have any specifics in it regarding this, and I have searched the forums and google on what is required. No luck!
here are the steps that i took
openssl.exe genrsa -out .\duo\duo.key 4096
openssl req -new -sha256 -key .\duo\duo.key -out .\duo\duo.csr -config .\duo\openssl.config
i then took the CSR to my Issuing CA (certssrv), requested a cert using the CSR and downloaded it as a Base64 P7B file
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in .\duo\certnew.p7b -out .\duo\duo.pem
i moved the PEM and KEY to the Auth Proxy, dropped them in the CONF folder and updated the authproxy.cfg file as follows:
ssl_port=636ssl_key_path=duo.keyssl_cert_path=duo.pem
restarted the Duo Auth service, which started fine. But when i go to my test instance of Confluence and mod the LDAP Config to point to the Auth Proxy, it fails to work with:

Does anybody have some tips for troubleshooting 919 errors when trying to connect to MS RRAS using L2TP with PAP? My server is running Windows server 2012 R2 with RRAS and NPS installed, on the same box as the Duo proxy. The network policy in NPS has been set up to allow only PAP authentication.
In RRAS, I have configured L2TP to use a shared secret. I’ve also installed a server certificate in case it’s still needed with when using secrets instead of certs.
Client in Windows 10, configured for L2TP with PAP and the secret key. When I try to connect I consistently get a 919, with no events on the server or entries in the duo proxy log file.
The interesting thing is, if I set up the server and client to use a different authentication method, like MSCHAP 2, I get a different, more expected failure - I can see in the proxy log file that duo can’t process the password since I’m not using PAP and I do see Windows events showing that NPS rejected the connection.
So when I consider both of these, what I’m thinking this suggests that L2TP is configured OK and my L2TP secret is correct … but I’m running into some kind of issue specific to PAP. Anybody else seen this? Do I need to adjust a security setting someplace to allow PAP on Windows?
My read of the documentation is that PAP is required for this kind of setup. Any chance I’m wrong about that and there is a way to get a different authentication method to work?",0

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) 3.2 went into effect in October 2016, with requirement 8.3.1 (expanded use of MFA) coming into effect on February 1, 2018. In the meantime, the PCI Council has come out with an MFA Supplement that sets forth some guidelines that may possibly be incorporated into the standard at some point in the future.

I’m trying to provide 2FA to a small subet of users to specific computers using RDG but found that all connection and authorization policies are no longer available if using Duo for RDG.  So I attempted to install the DuoProxy and direct attempts from RDG to the DuoProxy for 2FA, so I could continue to use RAPs and CAPs in RDG.  I’ve had some success but am getting an odd error message about “none objects can be quoted” when the proxy forwards the authentication info that it receives from the RDG to Duo.
I could not find any documentation around either further scoping the users and resources in RDG when using Duo, nor any about forwarding RDG NPS auth requests from RDG to Duo, then back to RDG for connection.  Is there any guidance around these scenarios?

I’m currently in a scenario where I’m trying to automate some tasks in AWS using PowerShell. In our environment we authenticate to AWS via ADFS with DUO MFA it then passes this token to the AWS SAML provider. Using this method I’m given access to 200+ AWS accounts now I want to use the AWS PowerShell modules to enumerate all the accounts available to me then query each account for all the EC2 instances they have provisioned.
What I seem to be having issue with is I technically should be able to login to ADFS via PowerShell, get my token then pass that token to AWS but I’m not getting my token from ADFS because I assume it’s not actually logging in because it’s not doing a DUO authentication.
Does anyone know a way around this?

I’ve been in the process of a proof-of-concept of Duo for a potential large’ish-scale implementation across our Enterprise. We’re currently syncing with Azure Active Directory as this hits a few sweet spots for us but I’ve ran into a bit of a speed bump where this directory sync is concerned. Namely Azure AD sync with Duo will only bring over our UPNs.
We’re a bit unique in that our UPNs “simplified” does not equal our SAM/NTLM account usernames. By and large this isn’t a big deal-- most of our solutions use UPN without any difficulty.
However with Remote Desktop Gateway we’ve hit a snag. After enabling debug mode in the Duo Remote Desktop Gateway application I can see even though we provide our UPN to RDG for authentication, the Duo Remote Desktop Gateway application log can only see an authentication request using our NTLM usernames-- which naturally we get “user must register” error thrown because it doesn’t recognize the username being non-UPN.
I realize this is probably something that RDG is doing behind the scenes, but I can’t for the life of me think of where I could go to to fix this. At this point it seems our only recourse is to use Local AD Sync and retest everything on SAM/NTLM usernames.
Has anyone encountered this before? Is there something easy I’m missing somewhere?",0

If I add the RDP/Login to duo, it’s easy enough to set it up for only enrolled accounts to be asked for additional authentication, that’s fine.howeverthe moment I add a new account it locks that account from logging in.  This presents a problem, since you can’t send an enrollment email without adding the user - which prevents them logging in to receive the email.
I need to set duo up so that someone who has been sent an email but not enrolled is allowed to enroll in their own time - enforcement is months away… it needs to be voluntary.

I was highly disappointed to see that the feature for Windows interactive logins was only applicable to all logins on a target workstations.  I assumed incorrectly that the credential provider relied on the use of the Auth Proxy, which performed the necessary lookups and bypassed secondary auth or required secondary auth.
I see that it’s possible to administer credential providers in a variety of ways, but do not see a way to redirect login requests from a workstation to an alternate LDAP server (for instance), which is okay and a little bit out of scope.
If I remove the key underHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\Credential Provider Filters\, with the GUID for Duo, I am able to select “Sign-in Options,” which is unavailable with the Credential Provider Filter present.  This is partially acceptable, as once this change is made, the Default Provider falls back to the PasswordProvider (the “regular” provider in Windows), however we would require the enforcement of the use of a Credential Provider for a specific user… something that I’m not sure is possible as Credential Providers are “stand-alone” on local systems and only integrate into systems as they are specifically designed (there isn’t an AD attribute that I have found that would specifically require a credential provider having been used for User N).
I have posted about a hopeful alternative in the MSFT forums:https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/8e77105c-dcd3-4b10-9660-dff4c7418568/is-it-possible-to-enforce-credential-provider-per-active-directory-user?forum=win10itprosecurityand cross posted on serverfaulthttp://serverfault.com/questions/832570/is-it-possible-to-enforce-a-specific-credential-provider-per-active-directory-us
Is it possible to use Duo for secondary authentication only for specific user accounts for interactive Windows logins across any host on a network?  For instance, we wish to protect only certain accounts, let’s say contoso\admmatt, but not bother others, like my user contoso\matt.  Is it possible to leverage SAML with ADFS in some way?
Thanks,

Is there is any documentation on how to renew the SSL cert with Duo installed in unified mode on Windows 2012 RDS?I have renewed the RDS side of things successfully, but kept getting errors on starting the remoteapp via the RD Web console.After much digging around, found that there was a signing cert hash setting in a file called duo,config which i can’t find any references to. updating the hash to match the new cert fixed this.And I don’t recall having to select a certificate for signing when first installing Duo.

I’ve been getting intermittent problems starting a remoteapp in the browser since day one. Event viewer show:
The user “user1”, on client computer “a.b.c.d”, did not meet resource authorization policy requirements and was therefore not authorized to resource “rds2012.server,com”.The following error occurred: “5”.Turns out that my connection out to the web goes through several different proxies and they are dynamically chosen and hence different public IPs. I managed to figure out that there was a client IP validation setting in the duo.config file. This by default sets to True, setting to false gets me around these circumstances.
So got me to wondering where do I find ref docs about all config settings possible with registry keys and duo.config and anything else I haven’t come across my googling?Are these local settings controlled via the web admin portal. I have the free version so I can’t verify these settings. But the resources on the website doesn’t confirm this.

We also use OneLogin as our SAML provider and have it configured to use Duo for 2FA.
The Slack application for both Mac and Windows uses an embedded version of Chrome. When our users open Slack, they log in using their OneLogin account. They are then taken to the Duo approval part and are blocked because the version of Chrome used in Slack is more than four months out of date.
Contacting the Slack support team, they responded with:
Unfortunately, while Slack does its best to keep up with Chrome, we’re usually a release or two behind. You’ll need to either whitelist Duo or disable / warn-only browser checks. We consider this an acceptable trade-off because Slack is not a general purpose browser (i.e. it’s not navigating tomy-cool-news.ru, onlySlack.com). We can mitigate security issues with our app on the server side by detecting and censoring malicious content (i.e. content attempting to exploit the desktop app) far faster than we can by shipping new releases of the Desktop app, unlike the General Purpose Web.
Slack is guaranteed to have the User Agent string “Slack/”, if you want to set up Duo’s whitelist to ignore this entirely. The right-hand side is also guaranteed to be a semver-compatible string if you want to require people to run the latest version of the Slack Desktop app in order to connect.

The Help Center, located athelp.duo.com, will serve as the new home of the Duo Knowledge Base (KB) and support ticket management portal.
All pre-existing knowledge content has been moved to the Help Center and all new content will be published there. The support ticket management portal allows administrators to submit tickets to the Duo Support Team. Customers can update ongoing cases at any time and see a comprehensive record of their support cases. You will also be able to provide feedback on closed support cases to help us improve your overall experience and view satisfaction surveys that have already been filed.
While the KB side of the Help Center will be fully public, the ticket portal can only be accessed and utilized by the listed Duo Admins of Business, Enterprise, and Platform Edition customers. The ticket portal is currently in a closed beta phase and we would love to get customers involved in the testing process. If you’re a current Duo customer interested in participating in the closed beta, please reply here or send me a private message and we will get you up and running ASAP.
Some FAQs about the Help Center and the ticket portal:
How will different administrator roles work in the ticket portal?All Duo Admins of a given company with the “Admin” or “Owner” role can see the support tickets filed by other Duo Admins at their organization. Admins with other roles will only be able to see tickets they have filed themselves. Read more about Administrative Roles.
Will this require a Duo login?During the private beta, the ticket portal will be accessed using separate credentials. Accessing the Knowledge Base will never require administrator credentials. When the Help Center is formally launched, accessing the support ticket management portal will utilize a Duo Admin login and be handled as a seamless SSO experience.
How should I use the Help Center and ticket portal?We want to have a chance to watch you use the platform and get your feedback on it. During the beta, please file any cases you would normally send tosupport@duo.comvia the “New Case” option in the My Support Cases section of the Help Center. Feedback can be provided by emailinghelpcenter@duo.com.",1

The updated regulation requires organizations to develop a cybersecurity program and written policy to protect the integrity and privacy of confidential data.
The DFS also pushed back the implementation deadline from the original date of Jan. 1, 2017 to March 1, 2017. Organizations must meet compliance requirements within 180 days of the regulation’s effective date.
The new regulations also require organizations to notify the DFS within 72 hours of determining that a security incident has occurred.

One problem I have seen with “push based” authentication system without any challenge input, is that a fraudster could call the victim and say like “hey im calling from the bank, there is fraudulent charges on your account, login to your account and see for yourself”.The victim initiates a login, but at the same time, the fraudster also initate a login to the victim’s account at the same time.
If the fraudster times this right, the Duo Push prompt will be for logging the fraudster to the account, while the victim thinks its for himself. And the victim didn’t do anything “wrong” security-wise, as the victim did as you should do, never follow any links or adresses a fraudster sends, but instead type the correct URL and login itself to verify if the information given, is correct.
Why isn’t some challenge requested in Duo Push? It could be a 4 digit code on computerscreen, that the user enters into the mobile, in the Duo Push request to “Allow”. If the 4 digit code entered, does not match the 4 digit code contained in the actual push login request, the login request is automatically rejected. (because obviously, then its a mismatch between the push request and the session the user intends to authenticate).",0

The best way to establish trust in your users’ devices is to use hardware-backed cryptographic properties, but how can you trust the devices in your ecosystem when attackers are able toobtain root access by exploiting known vulnerabilities, and root detection is becoming increasingly difficult?
Google is paving the way for hardware-backed cryptographic device attestation on Android with their SafetyNet API. The API determines if a device is in a normal, functional state.
As a fast-paced security company, we’re heavily invested inTrusted Accessand Trusted Devices is a crucial pillar of Trusted Access. Duo’s Platform Edition allows administrators to set policies to only allow trusted devices to access their company’s sensitive data. In order for a device to be trusted, it cannot be tampered. Duo’s tamper detection not only includes standard rooted/jailbroken detection, but it also utilizes Google’s SafetyNet API for identifying tampered Android devices.
We will start rolling out our enhanced tamper detection as early as later this month and would love to see more industry leaders adopt hardware-backed remote attestation too.

I have a RDS2012r2 and I want to install DUO on it. I have no idea which is the best way to do.(1) I have users direct connect to the RDS server using RDP connection.(2) I have users use RemoteAPP on Android to connect RDS server(3) I have users use RDWEB to connect RDS server

Over the past year, the product design team has made usability testing a central element of our design process. Every two weeks, we conduct moderated, remote testing sessions with users who try our interfaces while telling us what they’re thinking. Where they struggle, we likely need further iteration. Where they accomplish tasks with ease, that’s a sign of good usability. Building an in-house usability testing program has involved a lot of resources, but the results are worth it.

We’re failing at the security fundamentals, and breaches are still happening, day after day.
Part of the reason is, security was often approached as a bolted-on feature, added onto our systems as an afterthought - solutions like antivirus and firewalls alone no longer work to protect an increasingly complex attack surface with a disappearing network perimeter.
Applying security after the fact isn’t helpful to protect against the same security problems anymore. That’s partly because we’ve moved from on-premises everything to a mass migration to cloud-based web applications. Our data and apps are living not only on infrastructure we own, but also on servers that we don’t own. We don’t know exactly who is accessing what, and how.
Allowing access to these web applications involves two major components - verifying the identity of users accurately, and ensuring the security health of their devices. Ensuring their devices are secure has become a more challenging task, as employees are increasingly using their own smartphones, tablets and laptops to access work apps and data from remote working locations, from many different networks.
Within the information security industry, we’ve long built security technology for technology - but at the end of the day, our users are human, after all.

To do this, Redis keeps a copy of data in memory to provide speed and on disk (this is important) to prevent data from being lost if Redis is restarted.
Companies use Redis to store and retrieve data quickly and easily. Redis is intended to be used in trusted environments, and so it ships with a permissive security configuration, which is fine, unless you just put it on the Internet. That said, one of the fundamental laws of the Internet of Things is that if it can talk on a network, someone will put on the Internet.
The issue is that we see many devices running Redis that are exposed to the Internet, which goes against the recommendations made by the Redis developers. Exposing Redis directly to the Internet allows attackers to view/modify the stored data. Even more importantly, attackers are able to remotely configure the Redis instance, which can lead to a complete compromise of the device.
Duo Labs set out to measure how many Redis instances were exposed to the Internet and potentially vulnerable to attacks. Here is a brief summary of their findings:
There are over 18k Redis instances exposed to the Internet, a vast majority of which are running an out-of-date version of RedisWe found automated attacks scanning the Internet trying to compromise devices running Redis with fake ransomwareEvidence of these attacks was found on 13k (72%) of the hosts running Redis, indicating that the hosts could be compromisedAfter setting up a honeypot to catch attackers, we recorded an attempted attack in just hours

They also found that two out of three targets were hit multiple times. Bournemouth University reported they suffered a total of 21 different attacks throughout the year.
It was also reported that the majority of universities suffered attacks despite the implementation of antivirus software, oddly enough. Antivirus is not an effective standalone security solution, nor enough to stop a ransomware attack. In fact, AV solutions only detect about 45% of cyberattacks, as Symantec was quoted estimating in The Wall Street Journal last year.

We started to learn more and more about different threats, and then about the latest security tool to fix each of them, and we just had to have them all (insert Pokémon Go joke here).
So we dutifully kept adding on solutions that required extensive time to install, update, deploy and maintain - stretching our IT admins and teams thin, while generating massive logs of security alerts and data. Our systems became bloated with software, but were they actually effective when it came to preventing and mitigating threats?
A research analyst at Gartner, Elizabeth Kim reports that the world-wide cybersecurity market reached $75 billion in 2015, and is estimated to reach $170 billion by 2020, according to their report titled Cyber Security Market by Solution (IAM, Encryption, DLP, Risk and Compliance Management, IDS/IPS, UTM, Firewall, Antivirus/Antimalware, SIEM, Disaster Recovery, DDOS Mitigation, Web Filtering, and Security Services) – Global Forecast to 2020, as reported by Forbes.

The number of breaches are rising, because our security practices were created for a different time - a time when protecting the network perimeter was considered enough to keep the adversaries out.
That’s why it’s time for a new security approach that focuses on prevention as the most effective form of protection. Instead of fighting against the consumerization of technology that has brought with it a new wave of user-owned personal devices to the workplace, Duo has embraced it, incorporating it into our approach to security.

Mikko Hyppönen, Chief Research Officer at Finland-based F-Secure, gave the keynote address at the event. He went into detail on the history and evolution of ransomware, including the state of ransomware today.
An excerpt:
infosec-europe-ransomware.jpg1024×624 76 KB
What’s Old is New Again
Essentially, old problems come back to bite us - that is, the kind of problems that we thought we’d already solved. One example is the AIDS Trojan discovered in 1989. It’s considered the early example of ransomware, which is now targeting hospitals, governments and enterprises alike.
The software ranks you based on your risk of getting HIV. If it was installed without paying the license fee, it would overwrite your master boot record, encrypt your data and display a ransom demand to send payment to a P.O. Box in Panama.
Similarly, Petya, a type of ransomware found in May 2016, infects your system, reboots, checks disk, runs and encrypts your files. Both old and new ransomware encrypt the master boot record and indexes, then demands ransom; however, the new one asks for bitcoin money transfers.
[…]
Studying Modern Ransomware
Mikko mentioned that all of the many different ransomware types come from ransomware gangs that compete against each other. In his research, he’s tracking over 100 different groups.
Each group is looking for a return on investment and new customers to infect to make a profit. In April, the first ransomware Trojan to target Macs appeared. This Mac ransomware scans your network looking for Time Machine servers, that is, it tries to locate and encrypt your backups.
While Mac users represent a smaller percentage of users overall, there is no other ransomware competition in the market - meaning it’s a profitable one. As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin transactions are made public, and anyone can download the ledger to see the anonymized ransomware transactions that show online criminals are making hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Mikko.

Wired also covered how some of the manufacturers reacted to our findings.
As varied as their security stances were, the vendors also varied in how easy they made it to report security problems. While Lenovo, HP and Dell, all had direct channels for reporting security problems with their software, Acer and Asus did not, leaving Duo researchers to attempt contact to their customer support lines channels multiple times via email and phone calls before they got a response.
How the vendors responded to the researchers also varied. HP has already patched the most egregious vulnerabilities the researchers found. Lenovo addressed its problems by simply removing the vulnerable software from affected systems. Duo reported the problems to the vendors more than four months ago, but Acer and Asus still haven’t indicated when they will fix the problems or if they will.
“Asus told us they were going to patch in a month, then they backed off on that after we pointed out that their planned patch was also flawed,” says Steve Manzuik, director of security research at Duo Labs. “And that’s when our communication broke down with them.”

They identified numerous critical vulnerabilities within Dell, HP, and Lenovo devices, to name just a few.
Duo’s Darren Kemp broke it down in his blog post on the report:
Today, Duo Labs is publishing our take on the OOBE; Out-of-Box Exploitation: A Security Analysis of OEM Updaters. Shovelware, crapware, bloatware, “value added” - it goes by a lot of names - whatever you call it, most of it is junk (please, OEMs, make it stop). The worst part is that OEM software is making us vulnerable and invading our privacy. Issues like Superfish and eDellRoot make us less secure and are often easy to abuse in practice. With that in mind, Duo Labs decided to dig in to see how ugly things can get.
One of the major things we found was the presence of third-party update tools. Every OEM we looked at included one (or more) with their default configuration. We also noticed that Microsoft Signature Edition systems also often included OEM update tools, potentially making their distribution larger than other OEM software.
Updaters are an obvious target for a network attacker, this is a no-brainer. There have been plenty of attacks published against updaters and package management tools in the past, so we can expect OEM’s to learn from this, right?
Spoiler: we broke all of them (some worse than others). Every single vendor had at least one vulnerability that could allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM. We’d like to pat ourselves on the back for all the great bugs we found, but the reality is, it’s far too easy.
Here is a quick breakdown of basic features from some of the updaters we looked at:
