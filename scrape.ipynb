A few days ago, I had to reset my Instagram password on the account that I use for my business. I had previously set up 2 Factor Authentication with the Duo Mobile app, but when I went to get the code from the app to be able to sign in to Instagram again, it showed that my account had been disabled and was no longer connected. However, in order to reconnect, I needed to do it from my Instagram settings. Since I changed my password, I was logged out of my account on all devices and now I’m stuck and locked out of my account. None of my backup codes worked despite trying them all several times and I’m not sure what else I can do. Instagram’s Help Center has not been useful either.

A few days ago, I had to reset my Instagram password on the account that I use for my business. I had previously set up 2 Factor Authentication with the Duo Mobile app, but when I went to get the code from the app to be able to sign in to Instagram again, it showed that my account had been disabled and was no longer connected. However, in order to reconnect, I needed to do it from my Instagram settings. Since I changed my password, I was logged out of my account on all devices and now I’m stuck and locked out of my account.

      "Setting up Duo Unix (pam_duo) is relatively straightforward from the documentation, and Duo provides an additional help-article athttps://help.duo.com/s/article/ka070000000fzxYAAQ/2231if you want to use passwords.  However, this does not play well if you are using (in our case) SSSD, RedHat’s offering that allows you to integrate with LDAP, AD, and so on (using a Kerberos ticket from your Windows PC will bypass 2FA completely, which we also do not want).  Additionally, we needed to support both AD accounts as well as local-accounts (for our remote-monitoring NOC to login), and we wanted to use 2FA for all involved.\n",

Everything is working as expected using DUO push, or the 6 digit passcode.  However, we now have a use case to use YubiKey and this seems to not work.  Any thoughts and recommendation how I can get this factor to work?

This is a huge gap we found when attempting to roll out the Universal Prompt that produced Incidents which forced us to roll back to the Traditional Prompt.

For us, this is a must have before the we can move to Universal Prompt because we use other options like LDAP/RADIUS proxies, and CLI integration.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity How to authenticate users to different AD groups based on a passed parameter Managing Users forum None DerekSmall https://community.duo.com/u/DerekSmall 2022-07-27 We have Fortigate firewalls for SSL-VPN remote access.  We have different portals, each with it’s own URL and access restrictions, which have been created to limit what parts of the internal network a given user has access.  So Internal users from VendorA might only be able to access Vlan10 and users from VendorB might only be able to access Vlan11.\n",
      "We do this by using a single Windows NPS server with mulitple policies.  Fortigate allows you to specify a NAS-IP parameter in each Radius request.  Normally this would be the IP of the Fortigate, but the NAS-IP can be anything (even a string which is not an IP address).  Each vendor has a specific policy on the NPS server then which matches the NAS IP (which represents that vendor), and an AD group that maches that vendor,  for a user to sucessfully authenticate.\n",
      "Authentication requests for internal users, to our internal users portal, are authenticated via a Duo proxy.  We now have a requirement to use MFA for vendor access as well.  As far as I know each Duo proxy includes only one AD group or list of AD groups, and that Duo proxy will only check group membership in that group or list of groups.\n",
      "I need a way to pass a parameter like NAS-IP, or some other Radius VSA to the Duo proxy, then have the Duo proxy check if the NAS-IP is say 1.1.1.1, then the user request must a member of AD group VendorA.  While if the Radius request has NAS-IP 2.2.2.2, then the user request must be a member of AD group VendorB.\n",
      "If I have to put all my vendor accounts into the same group and have the Duo proxy check for group membership in that common vendor group, then I no longer have a way to prevent VendorA from attempting to login tohttps://my.company.com/VendorBportal and vise-versa.  We currently have about 12 vendor portals defined and that is expected to grow, so having a dedicated Duo proxy per vendor portal isn’t a scalable solution.\n",
      "Is there some other way to solve this problem with Duo?  I was wondering about having the user authenticate via Radius first to the NPS (to check for correct group membership, then doing a defer to Duo for MFA.  I’ve set that up with Azure, but not with Duo and am not sure how/if that would work.  If that is even possible, then Duo would only need to handle the MFA part of the authentication request and not be concerned with AD group membership.\n",

In our company domain we used to use Duo for MFA. At the time this computer was joined to the domain. That division of our company closed and the computer was removed from the domain. It sat for years, unused. Over time we stopped using Duo for MFA needs. We now have a need to login to the computer. Because our Duo MFA local server is no longer available, we can no longer login to the computer even using the local computer account that was added after the computer was removed from the domain. Duo needs to provide a way to remove the software rather than just bricking the computer unless you want to reinstall Windows. We specifically cannot reinstall Windows because the very reason we need to access this computer now is because it contains one piece of software with one specific file we need to access.\n",

      "I sell a web-based application for customers to install on their own websites.  It has its own internal user database and authentication + 2fa methods, where the 2fa includes the typical options like webauthn, yubiotp, etc.  Sometimes customers request technical support, and as a result must add one or more of our staff as a user in their own copy of the software.  Upon login our staff should add a 2fa method, upon completion of the support request our staff are supposed to ask the customer to delete the user account they’d created for support, and then we of course hope the customer does so.  These are three steps all subject to human error.\n",
      "We would like to ensure there is no situation where such an account could sit there dormant to later be used in an unauthorized manner.  The idea is that since we already use Duo for MFA, we could release an update for our software that forces any account ending in our email domain to go do the second factor at Duo rather than one of the internal methods.  Then, even if an account is left around, and later has its password compromised, the login would only succeed if the account is also still present and active in Duo, and the bad actor is able to complete the Duo second factor for that particular employee.  This would put a stop to access by terminated accounts, those whose second factor was stolen and updated on our side, etc.\n",
      "We thought Duo’s Web SDK was the way to go but the secret key you’re issued seems to be able to create users in Duo.  Obviously we can’t bundle that into the software and distribute it.  We were hoping it was more like an SSH public key where having possession of it just means you could add it to other apps without authorization, but it wouldn’t compromise Duo or existing apps since they’d be using different keys.\n",

Also, after the screen tells me I’ve “answered” their call…it will eventually give me this error message: “Error during call: No keys pressed.” Obviously, there weren’t any keys pressed…I never received a call in the first place.

GP doesn’t complete the connection process if the user attempts to connect the VPN BEFORE they sign into Windows.  From a process-standpoint, here’s what we are seeing…\n",

      "Hello all,Creating a topic here to possibly get some help on an issue we’ve been running into using Duo MFA and macOS.\n",
      "We are deploying Duo through Jamf and we have no issues using the automated enrollment for Mac users that are in office. Our issue is with the Mac users that work remote. As i understand it by default macOS will not allow you to select or change wifi networks from the login screen. This causes conflicts with Duo to where a user is unable to login to the Mac because it is not connected to the internet and it will block a user from logging in, We have it set to enroll them into offline access as well, but this will not prompt them to do so until after they complete the 1st initial authentication while online.All of our Macs are on the latest software at the time of writing, 12.5.1 and we are using MacLogon-2.0.0.pkg being installed through a policy in Jamf Pro.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Trusted devices? Deployment Strategy forum None Simon_Weel https://community.duo.com/u/Simon_Weel 2022-09-22 This may be an incredible stupid question. But I have to ask. Here’s why.Some time ago, I tested IsDecicions Userlock as MFA solution. All fine and dandy. But: it only protects access to thepcthat has the Userlock client installed. In other words; it does NOT prohibit someone from logging on to a (Windows) domain. So if you happen to know the logon credentials of a domain user, then just bring you own pc, without Userlock client, connect it to the network, browse to a server and when it asks for logon credentials, just type in username and password and you’re in. Not exactly what I had in mind.\n",
      "So I wonder - does Duo work the same way? There’s a topic in the Duo documentation about Device trust, which is only available with Duo Beyond. This seems to imply the ‘lower’ versions of Duo would allow access to a domain in a similar way as Userlock. Any thoughts about this?\n",

Or at least a radial button in the Duo Admin Portal under Settings to DISABLE the option of Bypass Mode altogether?\n",
      "We have many systems administrators in our organization, each responsible for a branch of the organization. They need to be able to manage the users under their branch (hence the User Manager role). However, we have a strict enterprise policy of not allowing any user to be able to bypass Duo. They can get a temp bypass code no problem but we don’t want them to be able to bypass mfa.\n",
      "For now our workaround is to use a Splunk integration which triggers a script to reset a user to Active based on a Duo bypass mode event. Sometimes this can take a few minutes to execute the workflow and reset the user back to ACTIVE and that window of time is too long for our desired security posture.\n",

      "I’ve got an instance of a Google Workspace LDAP server. We’re a small organisation, and it’s worked well for us in the past. We have had OpenVPN authenticating happily directly to Google’s LDAP and I thought we could put Duo’s auth proxy in the middle in order to get a 2FA prompt.\n",
      "Google’s LDAP service is perhaps a little more complicated than others I’ve encountered. In order to use it correctly, you generate a “Client” and get a set of certificates that you use to connect that client. If you need the equivalent of a Service account, you generate some “Application Credentials”, which are valid only for that “Client”. If the certificate thing is incompatible with your client, you can utilise sTunnel as a proxy, which takes care of encryption/certificates for you and essentially allows clients to connect as if it’s regular unsecured ldap. I decided to use sTunnel for Duo just to take away that part of the equation.\n",
      "So my diagram of what’s going on is:\n",
      "OpenVPN, Auth Proxy and sTunnel are all running on the same machine. My configuration file looks like:\n",
      "OpenVPN is set upwithouta set of bind credentials, because if Idoput in the access credentials, I get:\n",
      "This is a bit of a pain. From what I can tell, Google don’t actually give you a bind DN for these service accounts, so I’ve removed the bind account for OpenVPN.\n",
      "If Idon’thaveexempt_primary_bind = false, I get through no problems - except no 2FA prompt is spawned (and it says excluding primary bind). So I’ve set that to false. If that happens, I get these logs:\n",
      "From what I can see here, it binds with the authenticating user no problems. Then it tries and binds with a blankdn, and Google returns with AUTH_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED (Secure LDAP service: Error code descriptions - Google Workspace Admin Help). I kind of understand that because there is no DN for that service account - it’s just Google magic for that client.\n",
      "As I started clutching at straws, I thought I’d use a real account in the Duo auth proxy instead of one of Google’s fake service accounts. I’d really prefernotto do this, as every account in Google costs $ per month, but I thought I’d try anyway.\n",
      "The config was much the same, but I specifiedauth_type=plainand abind_dnin addition to changing the service account user/pass.\n",
      "The debug messages are the same up until the binding as a blank user. Logs are below: it gets further, but then it thinks it can’t find theuidof the authenticating user.\n",
      "Google have an LDAP audit log, and I copied the query the auth proxy appears to be doing (and the base object, which from what I can tell is the authenticating user itself) and did anldapsearch:\n",
      "As expected, theuidis definitely there. It’s also spewed out in the Auth proxy logs, although I notice there it’s represented as an array (eg.['<authenticating_user>']) rather than a single string value. I also triedgoogleUidandposixUidas they’re all the same (and these all exist in Duo).\n",
      "I also noticed the “SASL username” outputted as part of the LDAP search and tried to use that as the bind DN in various places (OpenVPN, Auth proxy etc) but alas no luck there.\n",

Do I need to re-configure Azure AD Connect for ADFS or just install ADFS from Add Roles / Features and go from there?  I am a bit confused by the DUO SSO documentation.  It instructs from the perspective that Azure AD Connect has not been set yet.\n",

We have around 300 users in O/M365.  All users are on a single, custom domain.   We currently only have 20 users onboarded in Duo.  If we enable Duo Single Sign On for O/M365, will users who are not onboarded in Duo be able to bypass 2FA/enrollment and just sign in without 2FA?  The reason I ask is that we would like to enable Duo Single Sign On for just the users who are onboarded in Duo.

      "A third vulnerability rated as high risk remains unresolved in Authentication Proxy 5.7.1. This vulnerability results from the third-party Python framework Twisted version 21.2.0, which parses HTTP requests without validating that the requests conform to the RFC 7230 standard [CVE-2022-24801]. This vulnerability exposes HTTP requests handled by the Authentication Proxy to HTTP smuggling exploits that attempt to bypass access controls. The Authentication Proxy is vulnerable to this risk of exploit only if configured to usehttp_proxy.\n",
      "The Duo Authentication Proxy team is preparing to upgrade to Twisted version 22 for an upcoming software release. The Twisted version 21.2.0http_proxyvulnerability will remain high-risk until Duo releases a fix in an upcoming version of Authentication Proxy. We will announce the release in theDuo Community Release Notes.\n",
      "A fourth vulnerability rated as high risk remains present in Authentication Proxy 5.7.1, but the Authentication Proxy team has confirmed that the Authentication Proxy does not use vulnerable RSA decryption API code, and concludes that the Authentication Proxy is not exposed to this high-risk vulnerability. This vulnerability results from the Python librarypython-cryptographyversion 3.2, which is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing attacks [CVE-2020-25659]. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit the RSA decryption API to decrypt RSA ciphertext. The potential threat is unintended access to encrypted session data. A directpython-cryptographylibrary update is not an option due to OpenSSL dependencies on this library, so the Authentication Proxy team is researching the long-term resolution.\n",

      "We want to let you know that Duo is discontinuing our phishing tools to focus on multi-factor authentication and device trust features and functionality. On January 20, 2020, thePhishing Campaigns tool in the Duo Admin Panelwill be discontinued. On this date, Duo Access and Duo Beyond customers who purchased their subscriptions prior to November 25, 2019 will no longer be able to start new phishing campaigns from the Duo Admin Panel. The freeDuo Insight phishing toolwill also be disabled on January 20, 2020.\n",
      "Beginning November 25, 2019, new Duo Access and Duo Beyond customers will not have access to the Duo Phishing Campaigns tool in the Duo Admin Panel. However, they may still use the free Duo Insight phishing tool if they wish.\n",
      "On January 20, 2020, all data associated with Duo Phishing Campaigns and Duo Insight will become inaccessible. We encourage administrators to export or otherwise save information from their campaigns prior to this date. Additionally, beginning on this date, Duo Administrators with the Phishing Manager role will be unable to access the Duo Admin Panel. When Phishing Managers attempt to log in, they will see an error message informing them to contact their administrator. To enable Phishing Managers to administer Duo in other ways, consider having an Owner-level administrator change them to adifferent Administrative Role.\n",

Once administrative access was established, the attacker was able to change two-factor authentication (2FA) configurations and eventually bypass 2FA to gain access to cloud storage services.\n",
      "This scenario did not leverage or reveal a vulnerability in Duo software or infrastructure but made use of a combination of configurations in 2FA (in this case Duo 2FA) and Windows native authentication workflows. This scenario can be mitigated through a policy configuration in Duo’s Admin Panel (details in the blog here). Duo recommends reviewing your configuration to make sure it meets your current business and security needs.\n",

I have contacted Meraki to have them increase the client VPN timeout value to 60 seconds, but this did not make any difference.

      "We have a Win2016 Hyper-V host that is not domain-attached running a Win2016 AD server VM called AD01 and a Win2016 RD server VM called ACT01. The ACT01 VM has all the RD roles – RD Gateway, RD Session Host, RD Web, RD Connection Broker, and RD Licensing, and is running a single LOB application – Act. Users in the same location as the server are running local copies of Act on their PCs to talk to the database on ACT01, and we have three branches that are on site-to-site VPN with 2-3 users each running Act via RemoteApp from the same server – not coming through the gateway, just doing straight RemoteApp sessions from their computers over the VPN. We also have about 4 users occasionally using the Remote Desktop Gateway for work-from-home – they are logging in through the gateway to either remote to their office PCs from home, or in one case, just run a RemoteApp session of Act. I also use the RD Gateway to administer ACT01 and the other VMs via RDP for full desktop sessions. I use a CAP/RAP policy to lock down the users that can use the RD Gateway and the machines they can talk to, and I make sure they have good passwords, etc., but it’s long past time to get everything all 2FAed up.\n",
      "Also running on the Hyper-V server is a completely different virtualized network on a private virtual switch – I completely virtualized their 18-year-old accounting setup. It’s a separate AD domain with its own Win2008R2 AD server, a Win2003R2 server running MSSQL 2000 and Great Plains 8.0 ERP/Accounting, and 6 Win7 Great Plains clients. The users RDP into the Win7 clients from their desktop PCs and run Great Plains from there. I know, I know, but I did what I had to do to keep things running – this was all physical machines when I started with these folks. At least now it’s behind a pfSense firewall that doesn’t let anything in or out except the RDP sessions from the local office PCs to the GP client VMs. And now we are finally in the process of moving to a cloud-based ERP/accounting solution, and the people implementing that want access to the production accounting system. I was hoping to use ACT01 as a jump host – they RDP through the RD Gateway to ACT01, and from there RDP to a Win7 GP client VM that I’ve set up for them on the private virtual network.\n",
      "What I want to do is 2FA the RD Gateway – so anyone using the gateway from the internet has to use 2FA. I don’t want to make the branch users using the RemoteApp version of Act from ACT01 to have to 2FA – they’re already on machines in the physical stores that are on the VPN, and presumably OK – if not I have bigger problems. But I want anyone coming into the RD Gateway from the internet have to 2FA to get an RD session, either to RemoteApp to ACT01 to run Act, to get a desktop session to use it as a jump host, or to connect to their desktop PCs.\n",
      "I tried installing Duo for RD Gateway, and it worked pretty much the way I was hoping to talk to any of the other machines behind the gateway - I started the connection, got a push, OKed it, and was able to login to the AD01 server and a couple of other machines. But RDP sessions to the ACT01 server itself started and just died after the push notification was approved. It worked for other machines – I got the push, approved, and logged in. But attempts to login to the RD session host with a desktop session or a RemoteApp session even from within the network, not through the gateway, would send a push, I would approve, and then the session would just close. I thought maybe I needed to install Duo for RD Web as well, and I tried that, but the install just hung before I got to the part where it asks for the keys. I was running out of time in my maintenance window, so I rolled the machine back to a pre-Duo RDG install checkpoint and we’re back at square one.\n",

      "The last 18 months have seen an exponential growth in remote work, forcing many organizations to accelerate their secure remote access strategy. Many have relied exclusively on VPNs to enable employee access to corporate resources. While effective, it is important to consider that shifting to remote work requires more flexible device policies to allow access to corporate apps and data from BYOD/unmanaged devices. Securing these resources means companies need greater visibility into user behavior and device posture, and the ability to enforce granular, application-specific policies to reduce the risk of data compromise. Adopting a zero-trust security strategy for remote access to internal resources can address this need, and Duo Security is ready to help.\n",

User None SPremeau https://community.duo.com/u/SPremeau 2021-12-07 We are in the inital stages of our deployment and struggling with how to allow users to “opt-in” to Duo without interrupting their critical work (at least without coordination).\n",
      "We are utilizing Directory Sync, and a group to control who is eligible for Duo at any point in time, so we have the “should be using Duo” and “not required to use Duo” part of the problem figured out.   Fully enrolled users are (as we are seeking), prompted for Duo as expected, and denied access if they are unable to complete the authentication.\n",
      "Where we are getting stuck is for users that have opted-in (or been opted-in because of their role), but have not yet enrolled.    Our preference would be to nag them to enroll, but allow them to continue without MFA for at least some period of time.\n",
      "The self-enrollment does not appear to offer any “skip for now” option, so we were pursuing a New User policy involving “Allow unenrolled users to pass through without two-factor authentication.”\n",
      "However, if we pair that with Authentication policy of “Require two-factor authentication or enrollment when applicable…” synced by unenrolled users forced to enroll, and if we use the “Skip two-factor authentication or enrollment when applicable…” policy, no users are prompted by Duo.\n",

Out of about 100 clients, five of them have run into issue with the VPN connection process.  When the process works, the user opens GlobalProtect, clicks ‘Connect’, approves the Duo Push notification, and sees a succesful VPN connection.  When the process fails, it is failing somewhere between the user clicking ‘Connect’ and Duo sending out the push notificiation.  Each user has had a slightly different experience when it fails.  Here’s what we have observed:\n",

      "We recently purchased Duo and have slowly started to enroll our users. We’re doing this in phases.

      "We have Duo working and set up with our RDS environment and has been working quite well for us so far. Since we have Duo working in our environment, we are able to see all authentications against us. We have recently started to see some very strange authentication logs. These authentication logs use the users SID to log in rather than the user names, and they’re at very strange times. The are apparently coming from Microsoft RD Web and have an unknown location with an IP address of 0.0.0.0:\n",
      "image1063×611 18.5 KB\n",
      "We are getting lots of these. What’s more scary is that some of these SIDs are users who already have Duo enabled and working. So it’s not even prompting the user to allow or deny the login attempt. Now, this could be ended by simply disallowing any user login that’s unenrolled, but we’re not there yet. However to think that it’s happening regardless, is a tad concerning as well. I noticed that my SID was included in the list. I’ve recently changed my password about a week ago, and it still appeared.\n",
      "Anyway, I hopped on our RD Web server and dug through the events in the event viewer. I found logs at the same time as the timestamps in the Duo authentication log. The logs were:\n",
      "(2/21/2020 12:38:39 AM) Event ID 4624 - An account was successfully logged on(2/21/2020 12:38:39 AM) Event ID 4634 - An account was logged off.\n",
      "These happened at the same time which I thought was odd too.\n",
      "Has anyone seen SIDs in the Duo authentication log before? Is Duo doing something to our RD servers or vice versa? Is our RD servers interacting idle sessions on our session host? Should we be concerned with anything?\n",

The device is Meraki MX 450 with support for Cisco Anyconnect. Authentication is provided to the Meraki with Radius/AD with a Duo Auth Proxy server.\n",
      "When you open Anyconnect and connect it talks to the VPN and prompts for username and password. When you enter the correct info you receive a Duo Push on your device. About two seconds later (literally two seconds maybe three) if you have not hit approve on the app or don’t have the app open staring at it to pop up. The VPN then prompts for username and password again.\n",
      "If you hit approve fast enough the VPN will show you are connected. Else hitting approve after will still show the success on the Duo Mobile but you won’t be connected to the VPN.\n",
      "Some things I tried were to make sure the Meraki, AnyConnect, and phones are all up to date. Also, I set the profile on Anyconnect to have timeouts of 30 seconds.\n",
      "From what I can gather is that the Meraki and VPN are not aware of Duo, it’s just an extra layer on the authentication side with Radius on the Duo Auth Proxy. It just seems like there is a missing timer on when the push is sent and the time to respond. I hope there is a setting on the Auth Proxy server but I don’t know.\n",

      "I’m setting up Duo MFA for a small business. I understand having a minimum purchase of 10 users, this makes sense to me in terms of overhead for managing accounts. but having to buy in 10 user increments seems punitive for small businesses. It means 11 users costs the same as 20 and that seems unfair. I really do think you should allow purchases in units of 1 user above 10. The 10 user increment feels extractive and customer hostile once you’ve got us onboard, and especially since the headline is $3 a user, not $30 for 10 users and 10 user increments after. I didn’t see the 10 user incremental purchase requirement until well after I had started the trial, it’s on one page on the main site under a long comparison table, while $3/user is everywhere - it feels very bait and switch-y, not a good look.\n",

Duo Mobile app forum None Amy https://community.duo.com/u/Amy 2021-12-14 This question frequently comes up in the Duo Community and support cases. Sometimes users may run into issues where they can no longer receive Duo Push notifications and reactivation is required. Since Duo Mobile is tied to the device’s Hardware Security Module, any changes to a phone’s hardware can affect activation status.\n",

The second time is most often then not successful, although I have at times had the login timeout twice in a row.\n",
      "I know there are a few things Windows wise we could do, such as setting the login timeout timer to a larger value in the registry keys. We have also tried ensuring that the system is up to date on drivers, BIOS, Windows updates, etc. just to be safe. Lastly we disabled all High demand start up services that are not required to see if the problem might lie in Windows itself taking too long to start, and therefore the DUO notification coming in too late.\n",
      "However, the Windows login timeout timer is managed by security groups on our AD server, and I seem to be the only one amongst my immediate peers that has this issue. I was hoping to ask the community if there is anyone who has experienced such an issue and if it is for some odd reason related to DUO and not my startup time that makes the push notification come late.\n",
      "I can’t test my start up time now that DUO is implemented company wide but I don’t recall it taking long to login at all prior to the implementation. I will be continuing to investigate why it might be Windows of course, as to tackle the issue both ways. But any feedback or experiences would be appreciated!\n",

The segments in this episode established many of the characters, running jokes, and themes that later episodes would reference. You can watch several segments from the first episodehere. Fun fact: For a time, a puppet version of Bullwinkle opened the show, and… “On one occasion, “Bullwinkle” encouraged children to pull the tuning knobs off their television sets. (“It’s loads of fun, and that way, you’ll be sure to be with us next week!”) The network received complaints from parents of an estimated 20,000 child viewers who actually did so. Bullwinkle told the children the following week to put the knobs back on with glue “and make it stick!” The puppet sequence was dropped altogether.”\n",

This is a question that comes up often in support cases and can have multiple different causes.\n",
      "The first reason this might occur is if the DAG does not identify the correct IP address for the user attempting to access the DAG admin console access (for example, resolving the internal IP instead of the external IP). This might happen if you deploy DAG as a virtual machine in externally hosted infrastructure (such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure), because the VM is typically assigned both an internal and external IP address. This can also occur if DNS is not configured appropriately for the type of access being attempted.\n",

I am a little unclear on how to set up inline/self-enrollment for use with Windows logon (Microsoft RDP app).\n",
      "Basically, I would like to have the Duo agent installed on user workstations and then have new Duo users log in and then get prompted to set up the Duo app ON THAT PC and then use the push notification.\n",

      "If I add the user in Duo (user name and email), when the user logs in, it just said the user is not activated in Duo.\n",
      "If I add a phone to that user, when the user logs onto the Windows PC, they only have the option to get sent a text code. There are no instructions to install the Duo app and enable push.\n",
      "It seems like the only way I can get it like I want is if I first enroll the users and they get emailed the link to set up the Duo app. The problem with that, is once Duo is installed on ALL computers, then new employees/Duo users won’t be able to log into Windows to check their email to setup Duo to log into Windows.\n",

Cisco’s site shows examples for Windows Git or CYGWIN, MACOS and Linux, and of course putty.  Network Engineers live in CLI and many of us prefer to have a fully functional and manageable SSH/Telnet Client (besides PuTTY connection Manager).  I use ZOC by EMTEC (https://www.emtec.com/).  The EMTEC team created an update to their Terminal product SPECIFICALLY for DUO access via the DUO Network Gateway.If you use ZOC, you must be running 8.03.2 and above:First Create a session:Click Configure next to Connection Type:Click Override Session Profile Settings, and then click Advanced SSH Settings:Under the Options Box, and in the Other Options text box, enter the following string, along with the FQDN of your DUO Network Gateway:-o “ProxyCommand=duoconnect -host %h:%p -relay=https://example.domain.com”image632×514 15.3 KB\n",

We use SailPoint IdentityIQ 8.0p1 as our IDAM and password reset solution, and I’m trying to come up with a way for new users to reset their temporary password, who don’t have a device enrolled in Duo yet. Our IdentityIQ implementation requires Duo MFA for all logins, and all new user accounts are forced to change their password on the next login. Since IdentityIQ doesn’t support inline registration, the reset process just fails. The users have active Duo accounts, which are being created by Duo using the AD sync process to pull all accounts in a certain AD group, and then sends the enrollment email to their company email address. They can’t get to this email without logging in, and they can’t login due to the issue mentioned above.\n",
      "Since I’m a developer in IdentityIQ, and we have already customized the MFA form in it, I’m trying to see if I can get the enroll_portal_url from Duo on the PreAuth call. Unfortunately, our Test Duo system is only sending back “deny” instead of “enroll” in the PreAuth response when the user has an active account, but no devices are enrolled. My Duo admin tells me its because they don’t have “auto-enroll” turned on in Test.(limited licenses) Is that why I never get the “enroll” response, or is there some other setting that I might need to have changed? I have also tried posting a message to the “enroll” endpoint in Duo, but then I get an error back stating that the account already exists. These are already active Duo accounts, so I’m not sure why the “auto-enroll” setting would matter, I’m just trying to get a new device enrollment URL to present to the user, instead of the one that is sitting in their inbox.\n",

However, there are a couple of features that seem to have been removed from v4 that just make my life a bit more difficult.\n",
      "I use my phone app to manage 10 different DUO accounts and have about 50 TOTP logins (soon to be about 150). Finding a TOTP code in that lot is a bit of a pain and card-based layout does nothing to assist with this. It is so disappointing that DUO still hasn’t implemented a folder system for the app.\n",
      "This takes me to one of the backward steps. In the v3 app, as well as renaming the account, you could also change the ‘Account’. We used this to group TOTP to a particular ‘account’ so they have the same icon making them easier to find. For example, we assign all our TOTP for mail servers to ‘ProtonMail’. They aren’t ProtonMail in actuality but it means they all have the same icon of a combined padlock and email. I know we can still do this when we setup the TOTP but we can no longer change it later like we used to do with the v3 app so when I want to reorganise my TOTP accounts, I no longer can.\n",
      "The other backward step is it is no longer possible to ‘refresh’ the app by pulling down from the top of the app screen. The only way to get a refresh is to force close the app and then open it again. Following  ‘patch Tuesday’ we have to update about 70 servers. This means a lot of authentications within a short period of time. For as long as I have used the app (several years), I have found that it stops responding to push notifications after about 20 or so in a short space of time. The workaround is to refresh the app which then allows the delivery of the ‘missing’ notifications. When dealing with 70 servers it requires quite a few ‘refreshes’. What I could previously achieve with a quick pull down from the top of the screen now has to be achieved with a forced close and reopening the app, something I have to do about a dozen times in the course of a session.\n",
      "I appreciate that there are a lot more standard users than advanced users but equally I have to use the app a lot more than a standard user. As a systems admin, I am authenticating at least 50 times a day. Why have you made my experience worse!\n",

      "Even if an individual end-user account is in Bypass, Duo is always working in the background and communicating with the application. Because theself-enrollmentprocess happens within the Duo Prompt and authentication is being bypassed, it will never be possible for the user to self-enroll while in “Bypass” status.

I am posting it here as I think it would be of interest to the Duo Community and perhaps help garner support for what I think is a missing feature in Duo.______________________________________________\n",
      "Duo is truly a very robust and configurable solution. We are current planning a pilot at our company. The one feature that is sorely missing is the existence of a “remember me” feature for Windows login. The same is true for that of RDP logins. As I wrote below, if it’s all or nothing, we have to very reluctantly elect to not at all protect Windows logins with Duo. This is highly disappointing and a glaring omission from Duo’s otherwise comprehensive protection.\n",
      "I do understand that cookies can’t be saved at that stage of pre-login.[A colleague]said that he spoke to the Duo folks at the recent DattoCon convention. He said that he suggested that Duo could use the IP address to identify a computer and allow it to pass through without Duo challenges on subsequent login attempts. Although it is possible to spoof an IP address, at least give the admins the option to rely on IP addresses to facilitate the “remember me” functionality for Windows logins if they so chose. And if for some reason, this specific approach still wouldn’t work, you have a bunch of clever people over there. I suspect you could figure out a way to make it work.\n",
      "Although the absence of this functionality probably will not stop us from becoming Duo customers, it has been very close to doing so. Instead of a very strong feeling that we’re comprehensively protecting our users, my feeling would be better described as mediocre. I urge you to prioritize the development of this feature. Duo and its customers – both current and potential – will all benefit.\n",
      "Thanks,Eli\n",
      "Hi Eli,\n",
      "First, I completely understand your concern and you are far from the only person who has them. I’ll try to technically break down all the reason we are where we are right now here so hopefully everyone has a complete understanding of how this works.\n",
      "As you mentioned, remembered devices works by setting a cookie, which is not possible in the win logon process (no browser).\n",
      "No way to whitelist based on IP right now.\n",
      "The ultimate reason both of these things are impossible is because the winlogon tool lives in something called the Windows Secure Desktop, which by design is a type of desktop that is completely out of scope of other application access. We didn’t necessarily choose to do that, but are somewhat forced into it. As architected by Microsoft, the actual Windows login is a subtype of the Secure Desktop, and to interact with that process, Duo has to live at that same layer, because as mentioned the Secure Desktop has no access to applications that live outside of it.\n",
      "It is true that even in that space, we do have visibility into the IP of the machine, but only as reported by Windows. This is a problem for a couple reasons. It is sometimes inaccurate, and NAT becomes a problem. In essence, when logging into a local machine we only see the LAN address, or when logging into a machine on the same LAN via RDP we also only see a LAN address because of NAT. We don’t support whitelisting private IPs for security reasons. For example, were I to phish your credentials and stole a company laptop (the common concern behind Duo for winlogon) and you had whitelisted a local IP in a policy, I could accidentally or deliberately bypass 2fa. I could potentially be on an open wifi network and get assigned the same private IP via DHCP (unlikely but possible), or an actual malicious actor could just put the machine on a network with a deliberately small DHCP pool.\n",
      "Simply summarized, we are a bit hamstrung by Microsoft architecture and we’ve deliberately limited one feature for security.\n",
      "All that said, we have a dev team solely focused on Microsoft integrations and they are constantly looking for another way to solve for this. I expect that in the future we’ll see more login tools because of webauthn and Windows Hello. This is a bit speculative on my part but I know that our internal teams are investigating these tools as a possible path to solving these issues.\n",
      "Hopefully this helps makes things a little more clear, and helps ease your concerns that it’s not being addressed. Please let me know if you have any more questions.\n",
      "Regards,Stephen\n",
      "Stephan, instead of crippling Duo’s protection on Windows login, it would be far better to allow the admins to make the determination whether to trust IP addresses as reported by Windows. We would rather enable such a feature, even if its benefit isn’t rock-solid, than completely leave Windows logins unprotected. (And the other extreme of requiring Duo authentication on each and every Windows login / screen unlock would be an unacceptable burden to users.)\n",
      "By way of analogy,Duo clearly statesthat SMS authentication isn’t really trustworthy, nonetheless, your documentation says:\n",
      "We view text messages as better than not having any two-factor authentication, since it still blocks attackers that can’t attack SMS technology.\n",
      "Granted, the IP reported by Microsoft might be the local IP, but when the request gets sent to your web servers at Duo, you are definitely getting the public IP of the computer. So you do, in fact, have that information. I would never expect you to whitelist a private IP as you mentioned.\n",
      "And regarding RDPing into a computer remotely, and it causing the same IP to show up on your servers even though the person (attacker) is remote, I agree that’s a concern, but let the client decide if we want to care about that. For example, if I know that RDP is not enabled on my users laptops, then I am fine requiring Duo when outside the corporate office, but not requiring it when inside. Leave the decision to us.\n",
      "Instead of making the decision for administrators, empower them – along with a warning – to make their own security choices.\n",

We recently added an optional field for pronouns to your community profile page. Pronouns are a shorthand way to refer to someone, such as she, he, or they. An important part of Duo and Cisco’s culture is kindness and treating others with respect, and that includes using the correct pronouns for people. We’ve made that easier to do in the Duo Community now with the addition of this field. You can easily share your pronouns with others if you’d like, as well as see theirs.\n",

      "Adding pronouns to your profile is completely optional. This change is to help make everyone feel more comfortable. Pronouns are an essential part of our identity and how we and the world around us refer to ourselves. Using the correct pronouns for someone affirms their identity and shows them respect. Conversely, using the wrong pronouns can be offensive or even harmful. In English, our most commonly used pronouns (he/him and she/her) specifically refer to a person’s gender, while they/them is a generic singular pronoun that can refer to someone of any gender.\n",

      "I’d like to give a friendly reminder that intolerance will not be tolerated in our forums. Per ourCommunity guidelines, which you can read here, we have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech and inflammatory or abusive language.

The group policy created with these steps works great.  Now what I am looking for is a way for this group policy to NOT run (and re-install Duo) every time the server or PC gets rebooted.I’ve read up on a way to create environment variables in a GPO and then create a WMI filter to use those variables to check if Duo is installed or not.  That way the GPO will only run if Duo is NOT installed.  However, I’m not very familiar with WMI filters.  Also, the only filter I can find is for .exe files and I can’t find any .exe files for Duo (only .dll files).Does anyone in the community have any experience in getting Duo deployed via GPO and getting the GPO to only run ONCE (e.g. when Duo is not installed)?\n",

The issue exists when I have two RADIUS servers are configured and the primary one goes down. I know the second one works because I have listed it first and it works without an issue. The issue seems to be with the client time out on the VPN adapter. Ive contacted Meraki support to change the time out value on the Meraki side but isnt enough time to get the Duo MFA push to the mobile device. I get a 718 error about 30 seconds and about 5 seconds later I get DUO push on the phone so I just miss it. Even if I push allow on my mobile device it too late since its already closed out the session. Is there a way to change the adapter time out or is there something else that needs to be configured to allow the 2nd RADIUS server more time on the client to allow the response?\n",

However, I don’t see where I can specify an authentication type of integrated.  Essentially, I don’t want to know the password, I don’t want the password stored in clear text, I don’t want the password stored in encrypted text.  I want the service – running under a specified service account – to perform an LDAP bind/query using the credentials of the account that is running the service.\n",

From what I can gather, the documentation Duo has created is for standalone OpenVPN server setups that are possibly Debian based. Since my setup is packaged with pfSense (FreeBSD), the directories are different than what is documented. I’m even noticing that the first step is causing an issue as “make && sudo make install” throws out errors (tried gmake and experienced the same errors). I’m wondering if anyone in this community has experienced this and what work around or documents you referred to? My pfSense 2.3.2 router is built on FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE-p5 and my OpenVPN setup works perfectly fine authenticating locally to FreeRADIUS2 using SSL/TLS+User Auth. All of this is handled within pfSense, there are no other servers or instances that I’m running within my environment I’m just looking to test out Duo with this setup to incorporate 2FA and appreciate any help I can receive around this.\n",

And last year as Cisco’s “Zero Trust for the Workforce” strategy came into focus, the security team began piloting Duo Beyond, building on the foundation of the MFA project to improve device visibility and policy controls for every user and every application. This change would affect over 100,000 users and more than a quarter million authentications each month, so for the sake of business continuity, it was essential that both users and systems were prepared for the switch. Josephina Fernandez and her cross-functional team (including Infrastructure, Endpoint and Infosec) were responsible for planning and executing the project, mapping out use cases and priority and building out the set of policies that would govern login attempts across the business.\n",

I’ve seen posts from 2016 with users requesting this feature with Duo team members responding that it’s “in the works”. Is it truly in the works? Is there any update anyone can provide? It looks like the last time DUO RDG received an update was 3 years ago.\n",

Networks None ESarac https://community.duo.com/u/ESarac 2019-12-11 Since the point of Office 365 is to allow access to your applications (in our case primarily email through Outlook) no matter where you are, restricting access to the DUO Access Gateway server is not really feasible based on source IP addresses. The user could literally be connecting from any IP based on what network they are coming from. It’s also not really feasible to filter on the firewall based on user group because unlike say a VPN connection with FortiClient, there isn’t going to be a way to check against an AD user group when the user tries to accesshttps://login.microsoftonline.comand instead gets the DUO Access Gateway SSO URL.\n",
      "I am curious as to how everyone is defining the firewall rule to allow access to the DUO Access Gateway. It looks like I have to define the destination as the DUO Access Gateway with port 443 and set the source field to “any” on the public WAN (Internet) interface of the firewall. Even though the server we built is on a secured DMZ network with only the necessary connections (to LDAP through read-only domain controllers, etc.), I still don’t feel too fuzzy about allowing any and all IPs 443 access to a server in our DMZ environment.\n",

      "When creating a VPN connection, setting Authentication method in the Security tab in the VPN’s adapter properties to PAP will change “Type of sign-in info” in the VPN connection properties to “General authentication method” from “User name and password”.  If I set it back to “User name and password” and set it, the Authentication methods are all deselected in the Security tab in the VPN’s adapter properties.  From what I understand, DUO requires the auth type to be PAP and a valid username and password needs to be issued from the Windows VPN client, however, this seems to be an impossible combination.  Does anyone have any ideas on a solution?\n",
      "UPDATE:  I have no explanation as to why, but MSCHAPv2 works.  The documentation states only PAP should work.  Did I miss something?\n",
      "UPDATE:  I don’t think it works with MSCHAPv2 after trying to reconnect resulting in failure.

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Packaging AuthProxy Authentication Proxy packaging | rpm modmedcorpit https://community.duo.com/u/modmedcorpit 2021-01-15 There’s something funny with the way you go about “installing” the authproxy software in Linux. It’s funny because you basically build openssl and python from source and then copy a bunch of stuff over. Although that “should work” in most Linux environments it’s not the way you’re supposed to install software, at all. Most Linux distributions have package managers, that handle integrity, re-installations, upgrades, removals, etc.\n",
      "We have successfully packagedduoauthproxy for RHEL7 and compatiblesand in the process of doing so we’ve identified some issues with the upstream code.\n",
      "Patched code\n",
      "It all starts with openssl, which is the first piece of software that gets built. Every Linux distribution will have a copy of openssl already installed, but you chose to ship, build, and install this one wich suggests you need a specific version or you added some custom changes, who knows; then cpython gets built. Now, this is a regular altinstall build (it would seem) using the custom openssl BUT the resulting build is way smaller than an altinstall using the official python sources which suggest that it’s heavily customized.\n",
      "What are those customizations, one might ask? Well, who knows, the source is provided as is, so one has to trust DUO’s openssl and cpython expertise. Here’s a suggestion:\n",
      "Could you provide the patches that transform the upstream code in your versions?You could make it part of your installation (download upstream + patch) or simply provide it somewhere else, so customers are able to audit the modifications. This is the main paint point in this regard: we’re running critical software (cryptographic engine and language intepreter) with modifications that potentially have very little QA/auditing done compared to the upstream projects as a whole (openssl & cpython). This also applies to the customized python modules that you use (not the ones you own butthe others).\n",
      "Fake versions\n",
      "One effect of this customization frenzy is that you end up with custom releases, which would suggest using a custom versioning, but you didn’t go that far. The problem is that you “ship” standard versioned custom releases, which makes the life of anyone trying to identify your software a living hell. Did you modified the code? Is it really version x.y.z? Well, it depends. Sometimes it might be, sometimes it definitely isn’t. Already went over your openssl & cpython issues, and those might or might not be standard versions; the situation in the python packages is just madness. Here’s a simple example:\n",
      "The duoauthproxy version 5.1.1, and a couple version before it, includeldaptor19.1.0, or that’s what you would think. The thing is that the duo shippedldaptorincludes anmd4submodule that doesn’t exist in the upstream version, which means that the version in duoauthproxy is not really 19.1.0 butsomething else.\n",
      "Could you please use the version metadata properly?There are several ways to go about it, you can do the trivial-postXsolution, use a custom-duoXmodifier or better yet, work with the upstream project to merge the changes there. By “faking” version numbers you’re making all your shipped packages “special versions” which is harder to audit and package.\n",
      "Wheels\n",
      "Not sure why, but you found that the best way to ship python code was to provide the source code. Although it mostly works, this hasn’t been the best way to go about it in the python world for a while now. For pure python modules (most of the ones you use) this is a no brainer: you get X version and build a wheel for it, or you download the already pre-built wheel from pypi, or you just let pip do it for you. For C based modules it might be more complicated (it was onlycryptography, correct?), but it is still better to build a wheel and then install it.\n",
      "Keep in mind that a wheel is stillthe source code(at least for the pure python modules), so you probably don’t need to worry about GPL & Co. but is way easier to manage than asource tree.\n",
      "Virtual Environments\n",
      "This is the intended way to customize a python environment and also to deploy your app. You only need the requirements file, assuming that you can reference the exact version that you need and you can provide the wheels to the non-public modules (not in pypi) although pip can download and build modules in case of missing wheels, if I’m not mistaken; you could even host a private index that pip could use to install your non-public modules (if you, for whatever reason, don’t want to publish them to pypi). With this method your app installer would become a simple requirements file (plus your custom openssl & python, plus some OS scripts, maybe).\n",
      "Technical debt\n",
      "There are some development decisions that are puzzling, at the least. Examples are:\n",
      "user & group are hardcoded into every script that needs it\n",
      "What if you need to change the user or group for whatever reason? Then you need to change the actual code. A better solution would be to leverage some kind of configuration file and module, likejsonorconfigparseror at least make itan optional command line parameter with a sensitive default.\n",
      "util.py\n",
      "I can’t recall where or when, but I’m pretty sure there used to be achdir()call in the root of the execution path in some module (this code here is tosavethe_home_dirbefore the chdir frenzy). Using cwd and chdir is a thing in bash (and other shells) but there are better ways to handle paths in python, namelyos.pathandpathlib. Any of this two modules will allow you to work with absolute paths and derivates which will ignore the cwd altogether (and that’s a very good thing).\n",
      "Skipping the outdated comment (how many versions ago did you migrated to python 3?) that right there is a hell of an assumption. This code expects your installer to create a non-standard tree where the directories are placed in a specific way. Isn’t the python standard virtual environment tree not good enough? You could at least use a command line parameter with this guess as the default (instead of burying it so deep into the code). BTW, the same assumption is made on the authproxyctl script.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Although we’re able to build an RPM our of yoursource codethere are several changes that you could implement to make the life of all packagers a little bit better. Thank you in advance.\n",

I might be more ham-fingered than most, but this happens to me about 1/10 of the time if I’m not careful.\n",
      "I can think of two possible tweaks that would improve the situation:\n",
      "Make the Deny/Approve buttons taller and put them side-by side. They’d take up the same vertical area, but would be harder to miss.   I’d also put “Deny” to the left and “Approve” to the right as  that would be easier for right-handed people (righties can use the edge of the watch as a physical reference for one of their other fingers).\n",

When you login, a propriety browser window opens and tries to render the login page for the Identity Provider.  When using Okta or Azure AD, this works fine.  But when using Duo as the SSO IdP, nothing renders.  I believe this is because the Duo Login page is rendered by running javascript which the SSL VPN browser does not support.

Duo has three methods Authentication Proxy, Duo Network Gateway, Duo Access Gateway, and I also know that Authentication Proxy uses RADIUS or LDAP for authentication. Duo does the second verification.Duo Network Gateway means to install Duo’s connection tool on the host, you can use Duo Network Gateway use ssh connect to internal networkDuo Access Gateway can be verified through AD or online or Google G Suite accounts online verification service\n",
      "I want to know what kind of environment these three types should be built in? All three are very similar. I can’t distinguish the pros and cons of each method. I hope I can mention it, thank all\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Duo Authentication Proxy ssl_ca_certs_file Does Nothing? | Protecting Applications forum None BrianMS https://community.duo.com/u/BrianMS 2020-11-20 I recently set up a Duo Authentication Proxy server.The primary authentication server supports plain authentication only, so I had to establish ldaps (or starttls) for the transport.To do that, I have to set ssl_ca_certs_file to a path pointing to the PEM-encoded certificate from the server.\n",
      "To do that, I fetched the certs with openssl (openssl.exe s_client -connect our.ldap.server:636 -showcerts), then copied and pasted the various certificate blocks into a text file and pointed ssl_ca_certs_file at that file.\n",
      "This all worked.\n",
      "Today, I was working on automating this process, because when that cert is changed out we’d have to update the cert that the ssl_ca_certs_file setting points to.  Otherwise Duo wouldn’t work and we’d be locked out of accessing things.  At least, that’s what I thought.\n",
      "In my testing, I found out that ssl_ca_certs_file doesn’t seem to do anything.  The connectivity tool will check to see if the file is there (and accessible).  It will throw an error if you specify starttls or ldaps for tranport and do not specify ssl_ca_certs_file , and it will throw an error if you specify ssl_ca_certs_file but the file you point to does not exist (or is inaccessible).\n",
      "It does not seem to check the contents of the file, or check the file against the certificate the server presents.\n",
      "Similarly, when actually trying to log in, everything works even if ssl_ca_certs_file points to an empty text file, or a text file with random data in it.\n",
      "Yes, I’m restarting the DuoAuthProxy service after making changes to the ssl_ca_certs_file that Duo is looking at.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Announcing the release of Duo Trust Monitor Release Notes None Kelly https://community.duo.com/u/Kelly 2020-12-04 We are excited to announce the release ofDuo Trust Monitor, a risk detection tool that helps Duo administrators identify and act on suspicious user and device behavior that could indicate account compromise.\n",
      "Duo Trust Monitor uses machine learning to analyze and model user authentication telemetry in order to create a baseline of normal user access behavior. After reviewing typical access patterns in an organization, Duo Trust Monitor highlights potentially risky logins for further investigation. By surfacing contextual information to Duo administrators directly in theDuo Admin Panel, Trust Monitor makes it easy to understand why a login was deemed anomalous.\n",
      "For example, Duo Trust Monitor can identify and flag such anomalous behavior as:\n",
      "Novel IPs or devicesUnusual authentication factors or times of dayAccess attempts against high-value applicationsRecognized patterns such as unrealistic geovelocity or brute force attacks\n",
      "Novel IPs or devices\n",
      "Unusual authentication factors or times of day\n",
      "Access attempts against high-value applications\n",
      "Recognized patterns such as unrealistic geovelocity or brute force attacks\n",
      "To help improve Trust Monitor over time, you can provide feedback on the surfaced events by marking them as suspicious or dismissing them. Marking an event as suspicious helps Duo Trust Monitor data science improve model precision by adapting its understanding of what constitutes normal behavior for a user.\n",
      "Duo Trust Monitor is available at no additional cost onDuo Access and Duo Beyond editions.\n",
      "To get started using Duo Trust Monitor, log in to the Admin Panel and go toTrust Monitorin the left sidebar. We recommend setting up aRisk Profilefirst. Your Risk Profile will tell Trust Monitor which applications, user groups, and locations/IPs are highest priority.\n",
      "Within one to two days, you will start seeing Security Events flagged by Trust Monitor appear in a dashboard in the Admin Panel, where you can triage and investigate. Over time, Trust Monitor helps you gain visibility into your environment and harden your security posture byadjusting or adding policies.\n",
      "Here are a few frequently asked questions about Duo Trust Monitor, and we invite you to comment below with your own question!\n",
      "What data does Trust Monitor have access to?\n",
      "Trust Monitor analyzes only Duo authentication data and administrator actions (such as surfacing when a user is put in bypass status). To see which data points Trust Monitor reviews, refer to thedocumentation.\n",
      "How long does it take to set up Trust Monitor?\n",
      "You can designate your Risk Profile in the Admin Panel in a few minutes and start seeing Security Events in the Trust Monitor dashboard in one to two days.\n",
      "I’m a new Duo customer. Can I still use Trust Monitor?\n",
      "Trust Monitor may leverage up to 180 days worth of historical Duo data to define a baseline. However, organizations don’t need this much data for Duo Trust Monitor to be useful. We recommend customers enable the feature after using Duo in their environment for at least six weeks.\n",
      "Can I use Trust Monitor in conjunction with my SIEM?\n",
      "Yes. Trust Monitor is a powerful complement to other security applications such as a SIEM, which can be configured to programmatically ingest event logs using various methods, including via theTrust Monitor endpointfor the Duo Admin API.\n",
      "Will Trust Monitor ever block my users?\n",
      "No. Trust Monitor does not block logins. It only surfaces information for you to review and take action on as needed. In the future, Trust Monitor’s insights into user access behavior may help inform an adaptive authentication strategy as part of a future Duo product offering.\n",

      "Not totally sure if I’m using the forum correctly but I wanted to throw a small suggestion into the mix.  Forgive me for semi-informal terminology since I’m not a developer, but I’ll try to be as specific as possible.  Duo Push notifications on phones (understandably) have a “tap to view actions” prompt, presumably meant to avoid accidentally approving a login request while interacting with notifications.\n",
      "The same prompt appears on Android Wear/WearOS watches.  The flow of interacting with notifications on WearOS devices makes this process a little slower than it needs to be.\n",
      "I wanted to suggest removing the “tap to view actions” prompt on WearOS notifications in favor of a notification with “nested” button prompts to allow or deny the login.  WearOS already supports this natively - for example, Gmail will show only the notification details in your WearOS notification bar, but will reveal button prompts to reply or archive an email when you tap the body of the notification.\n",
      "I appreciate WearOS support being implemented at all, and I think this small change would significantly improve the flow of utilizing Duo Push on watches.\n",

We have begun requiring DUO as an authentication layer for some of the website applications. This caused our web checks (http post commands) to fail. Even after getting an exemption set on the ID we use for the http post requests, we still have failures. After capturing and analyzing the packet flow, the request was redirected to DUO and as part of the authentication/exemption process it was determined that javascript/iframes was being used as the handoff process even for exemptions. Since we are using http post commands, there is not a full browser environment available for this type of interaction.\n",
      "If we connect interactively as the batch ID from a browser with javascript enabled, the target website is reached without the DUO authentication layer being required which validates that the DUO exemption for that ID has been properly set.\n",

If the VPN is left connected while the computer is unattended then we receive multiple prompts and the account gets locked out.

Duo SSO supports on-premises Active Directory (AD) and cloud or on-premises SAML IdPs as identity sources.\n",
      "By allowing users to access multiple applications with a single username and password, Duo SSO helps mitigate the risk of bad password habits while making it easier to work flexibly. You can even create access policies that can differ by application, depending on the sensitivity of its data and the privileges of the user, which reduces user friction while protecting your most important assets.\n",

General Discussion forum None colohost https://community.duo.com/u/colohost 2020-03-06 I’ve got a client with Duo set to block browsers if they’re out of date by a month.  They have users with Windows build 18363, which appears to date to December, and is otherwise still supported.  That release, if fully patched, has Edge 18.18363.  Duo is blocking this as out of date, even though they’re on a supported Windows build and that’s the current version the computer receives when fully up to date on patches.\n",
      "Is there any workaround for this besides either upgrading every client desktop to 19041, which just came out <2 weeks ago, or turning off the out of date browser block in the policies?  The latter unfortunately would affect all browsers since Duo doesn’t let you differentiate by browser, and turning that off for other browsers could be fairly dangerous.\n",

      "Environment:We have an On-prem AD Environment synced to our Azure AD tenant,  with hyrbid join enabled for workstations and sync for user/group objects. Nothing exciting there.\n",
      "Our AzureAD domain is Federated with PingFederate IDP - this results in users logging into SAML/OIDC protected applications being redirected to our IDP vs using the Microsoft Azure Native login page.\n",

      "Ping as IDP workflow:App > Ping > Duo for Ping > App\n",
      "Azure as IDP workflow:App > Azure Redirect > Ping > Duo for Azure via CA > App\n",
      "Problem:Once we started to Hybrid join our workstations to Azure AD (which automatically enables Azure SSO functionality), applications that we protect with AzureAD via SAML (Cisco AnyConnect for example) do not prompt users for DUO. The application is SSO’ed by the JWT on the Hybrid joined device and away they go. I mostly understand the WHY behind this - the Windows auth token is considering me a valid user as I made a MFA logon to another Azure protected App recently and is marking me as “good to go”.\n",
      "The question is, what mechanisms do I have that would allow me to FORCE a duo prompt to the user for certain workflows in the event I needed to? So far the only way I have gotten this to work is by implementing a session duration limit of 1 hour on some applications. The end result is that users that login to the windows GINA have 1 hour to SSO into an application before they are prompted. Its pretty cheesy.\n",
      "I realize this is a AzureAD/Conditional Access issue and not a DUO issue. I am asking this here in case someone else has come up with a neat workaround. It appears AzureAD treats 3rd party MFA significantly different in these workflows then their own MFA.\n",
      "SummaryIn summary, AzureSSO (enabled by the Azure Hybrid join process) will skip the 3rd party MFA custom control in conditional access at its leisure, and I cant figure out how to FORCE duo to prompt for workflows we require.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Account and Subnet Bypass Policy Protecting Applications forum None rarmstrong https://community.duo.com/u/rarmstrong 2020-08-19 We have OWA protected by Duo.  AD users are placed inside a “Duo Security Users” group and that group is synchronized into Duo Admin.  That group provides access to the OWA Application.  We have a Local Subnet Bypass policy configured that bypasses 2FA if OWA is accessed from a device inside the local network.  This all works great.  My question is this.  I removed the Domain “Administrator” account from the “Duo Security Users” Group and that account is no longer synced into Duo Admin.  After I did that, the Administrator was no longer able to login to OWA EVEN though subnet bypass is enabled.  Does a user account have to exist despite having a subnet bypass set?  I was under the impression that since a subnet bypass policy was set, that ANY user, despite NOT having an account synced into Duo could access the application because 2FA is ignored for that subnet.  Perhaps I’m not correct and ANY user needing access to OWA must have an account in Duo and that a Duo license will be consumed by that account despite having subnet bypass policy applied.  If I add the Administrator account back into the group and synch it, then that user can login to OWA.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Opening a 'feature request' category (or maybe Feedback is that?) Duo Feedback forum None GwynethLlewelyn https://community.duo.com/u/GwynethLlewelyn 2020-08-12 There was a discussion a bit over a year ago, under the General Discussion category, where@Kimberlyasked for aGeneral request for Feature request upvotes. In other ways: a public space where suggestions, feature requests, improvements, future development, etc. could bepubliclydiscussed, between Duo users and the company team.\n",
      "According to@Amy, the current company policy is the following:\n",
      "While I have verified that these specific requests have been filed in our internal platform, please share any future feature requests with your Account Executive, Customer Success Manager if applicable, or our Support Team.\n",
      "Now, many Duo users are (not yet) Duocustomers, even though they use Duo profusely on a daily basis, or have even developed integration with Duo on platforms for third parties (which, in turn,maybe Duo customers, while the developers might not be). It’s obvious that in those cases there aren’t ‘Account Executives’ nor ‘Customer Success Managers’ to contact with ideas; all that remains is contacting the Support Team.\n",
      "With due respect for the excellent professionals working at Support, I can imagine that they will be easily swamped over sorting through all the proposals and suggestions coming in fromnon-payingusers — which means that they will have to juggle priorities and start addressing issues frompayingcustomers instead. This would be most acceptable in all circumstances; also, when contacting Support, one assumes that there areseriousissues regardingimmediatetechnical support, and any Duo customer (and most non-paying users as well!) would not really wish Support to ‘spend too much time’ with issues not directly related to technical difficulties with the Duo ecosystem/framework.\n",
      "While I understand that there is aninternaldocumentation management system where all suggestions, feature requests, and so forth are duly archived on that platform, I tend to agree with@Kimberlywhen she says:\n",
      "Unfortunately, I may be the only such requester for these features and hope that other Duo customers will see value in my requests and submit their own Feature Requests to increase the priority of my own.\n",
      "In other words: there are possibly a lot ofsimilarissues fromdifferentusers/customers, all of whichmightbe addressed the same way; however, because these are filedseparately, the following occurs:\n",
      "When contacting support (or any of the other possibilities) with what we think to be anewissue, we have no idea if that issueis already in the queue. This means that Support necessarily will have to go through lots of potential duplicates, andmanuallysort them to forward to the appropriate team that might pick some of those issues for implementation. This takes precious time away from actually being helping customers with technical issues.\n",
      "Similarly, even if wesuspectthat other people have similar issues, wemightnot report these, simply because, well, someone elsesurelymust have reported it, right? This means that long-standing issues might go unreported just because ‘we all know that this must be being fixed’… when, in fact, wedon’t.\n",
      "Development teams have a limited time to code, and the decision on what to do will depend on some manager’s ‘intuition’ about how important fixing issue X is. Because Duo is used across so many platforms, technologies, and market segments, such a decision is anything but ‘easy’; all this decision-making manager has to work with is a database with hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of ‘unprocessed’ requests (in the sense that there will be certainly lots of duplicates, unfixable things, things already fixed or planned to do so, requests that are obsolete because the technology changed and made them irrelevant, and so forth), which, however, will have no easy ‘metric’ to aid such decision. The simplest metric (not necessarily thebest, of course) is simply to see a list of features/requests, without duplicates, ordered by the number of ‘votes’ given by the actualusersof the software. While certainly alotof companies donotprioritise their internal development decisions that way, many do so — because the input ofactual usersweighs a lot in theperceptionthat those users have about the software, and, conversely, fixing/adding a feature that is quite popular will, in turn, grow the users’ appreciation of the efforts made by the company to meet their needs.\n",
      "I understand that Duo is asecuritycompany, and, as such,many‘requests’ or ‘features’ are not really appropriate to be discussedpublicly, because such requestsmayinclude very sensitive data; as a result, I’m not proposing thatconfidentialrequests (and that includes eventual security breaches found, which shouldremainconfidential until a new release is launched that addresses such issues) are made public, but, rather, that the vast majority of innocuous feature requests/suggestions/proposals are handled on apublicforum — and having a Category in the Duo Community forums for that purpose would be excellent!\n",
      "Similarly, publicly-discussed feature requests/suggestions would allow a certain amount of discussion between users, which might result in several results even before the first line of code is written: proposals may get merged, or amended; users might contribute slight changes to existing proposals, which would go a long way to fix a larger range of issues; really unpopular suggestions — even though they ‘look good on paper’ and might even have been flagged for implementation! — will quickly become apparent during a discussion…\n",
      "There will be interactions between the development team (or at least a representative for them) and the user base. Typically, this could often ‘prune’ a feature request/suggestion by explaining how such a thing is technologically unfeasible, either in the short time, or perhaps even in the long time. This would allow a proposal — or a series of proposals — to be easily rejected, or archived, and stop wasting anyone’s time…\n",
      "Here are two concrete examples from my very recent experience:\n",
      "I’m currently beta-testing an application where there is an internal issue-submission tool allowing these kinds of discussions, as the launch date approaches and developers are swamped over with the code they still have to fix until the application can ‘go public’; over the past 2-3 months, more than 1400 issues have been raised, 800 of which have been either fixed or scheduled for future development — that way, beta-testers know they won’t need to insist on those 800 requests and focus their attention elsewhere; and developers will be happy to know that, when the launch date comes, practically all issues have been either fixed, or reviewed and postponed for future dates, thus allowingthemto switch focus to what needs to be fixed or implementednow; all this, in turn, gets publicly documented as a ‘roadmap’, giving beta-testers an idea ofwhentheir ideas will be implemented. Note that this is neither the first, nor the last application I’ve been beta-testing which uses this approach; and I have to admit that, in the past two decades, I have already seen many different approaches to this model; I personally like some approaches more than others, but I’d say that even the ‘worst’ model is better than, well,nothing.\n",
      "The other example shows how issues may go unreported for years, simply because we mightassumethat Duo is working on them, and will address them in a forthcoming issue… but we have no ideaifit was reported,whenit was reported, orifit’s scheduled for getting fixed… and this can drag over years!\n",
      "A few years ago, the WordFence plugin for WordPress (a very popular security tool) incorporated 2FA on their free version (unlike Jetpack’s, which is paid). I have WordFence on automatic upgrade, and a few days after upgrading, I suddenly noticed that I couldn’t log in on those websites that were protected with the Duo WordPress Plugin. The website worked normally; users not protected with Duo’s 2FA could log in without any issue whatsoever; and the logs didn’t report any obvious anomaly. But I, as admin, couldn’t log in. Thus, I had to manually remove all plugins, log back in again, and install them all over again. When Duo was installed, I had to set up 2FA again — making sure that WordFence’s 2FA wasdisabled— and everything worked for that session. A few days later, however, the session cookie expired, and I got a blank page when attempting to log in again. Baffled, I repeated the procedure; and, this time, it was clear that either Duo or WordFence, on their own, would give no problems, but ifbothwere active, it would be impossible to log in. There were no clues on either Duo’s or WordFence’s support areas. Icouldhave raised the issue then, but… surely peoplewouldhave noticed it before me, since, well,at least 20% of all the websites on the  Internet run self-hosted WordPress installationsand the WordFence plugin has been downloadedat least 3 million times, so, someonemusthave noticed this issue too and had already reported it’, I mightnotreport it because it must be ‘obvious’ that it must have been reported… somewhere? But where? It’s not here in the Duo Community forums; it’s not on theWordPress support forum for the Duo WP plugin; neither on theopen issues for the Duo WP plugin on GitHub; however, itismentioned on theWordPress support forum for the WordFence plugin, an issue which was ‘closed’ 2 years and eight months ago… without a solution.\n",
      "Eventually, as the poster on that WordFence support thread said, when choosing between Duo and WordFence, WordFence is far more important in terms of security, and since italsoprovides 2FA — even if just via OAuth TOTS — I just added it… to my Duo application. So I’m in the strange situation of having dozens and dozens of accounts on the Duo application which I usewithoutthe Duo protocol; while the few cases where Icoulduse the Duo protocol I’m unable to do so because of the conflicts with WordFence!\n",
      "I’m still waiting for a solution… because I refuse to believe that such an issue hasn’t been reported yet… but the truth is that, well, it has been a few years and I don’t even have a way to knowifthe issue was ever reported, or, if it was,whenis a fix due to be released!\n",
      "But I didn’t mean to use this Feedback category to surreptitiously file an issue— indeed, this category is meant to be for feedbackaboutthe Duo Communitysite. As such, I’m proposing that Duo adds anewcategory — let’s say ‘Feature requests and suggestions’ or something like that — which applies to feedback on the Duosoftware, andnotthe site itself. Such category would be employed by your support team to actually review and address all issues that aren’tconfidential. There would be some ‘rules’ for adding new topics, such as a pre-defined template illustrating how to submit a feature request, and imposing the rule that ‘likes’ on the first article would count towards ranking it upwards in the list of priorities (always assuming that the support and/or development teams have reviewed such a feature request, considered it worth their time, and approved it for ‘general voting’), as opposed to having people replying in comments with a ‘+1’ or ‘me too!’ (which is always annoying). Evidently, theactualcommitment by Duo to a specific feature wouldnotbe affected on how popular a specific feature request is; the popularity, measured in ‘likes’, would be onlyoneof the metrics used by whoever makes the decisions at Duo about the development roadmap. A very useful metric, as said, but never theonlyone.\n",
      "This would at least allow users — both paying and non-paying — to get an idea on which issues/suggestions/feature requests had been already proposed (the Discourse engine is not too bad at finding potential duplicates!) and, among those, which have a higher likelihood of being addressed in the future.\n",

      "Warren_R_Msft February 26, 2018\n",
      "Issue:\n",
      "You have a custom multifactor authentication login pages that leverage DUI API, and all works fine from web browsers but the Office client (Word, Excel, etc) fails to render all of the HTML property, you may see a flicker of the login page but in the end Office shows this error:\n",
      "“Your organization’s policies are preventing us from completing this action for you.  For more info, please contact your help desk.”\n",
      "Cause:\n",
      "When the DUO iframe is loaded from the “duo.form.login.template.html” file, the code is<iframe id=\"duo_iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350px\" frameborder=\"0\">Note that the SRC attribute of the Iframe element is missing, causing the iFrame to load the URL about:blank (The Iframe SRC attribute is set at a later point in the Duo-Web-v2.js file).  For security reasons Office does not allow navigation to any non-https end point within the webview which is shown to capture user credentials. The lack of a SRC attribute causes the embedded browser to load “about:blank” in the IFRAME which is not based on HTTPS and Office cannot allow such navigation to take place.\n",
      "Workaround:\n",
      "Specifying a SRC attribute for the Iframe element resolves the issue :<iframe id=\"duo_iframe\" src=\"images/TempImage.gif\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350px\" frameborder=\"0\">(Since we have a SRC, about:blank no longer loads, and hence the issue does not occur)\n",

      "Thanks for this. I was experiencing this issue with Sharepoint-hosted content protected by CAS + Duo. Users would enter their credentials and submit the CAS login form, then the embedded browser would close and the Office app would show the error above. This happened when opening Word, Excel, PP, and Visio docs as well as when Sharepoint lists were connected to Outlook. Sure enough, the markup for the Duo IFRAME did not contain a src attribute. Once I added one pointing to a blank document, the Duo view started rendering. This is with Office 2013 so the compatibility level of the embedded browser is pretty ancient. The Duo view doesn’t look very nice in it, but it’s functional. Thanks again for the post.\n",

DAG breaks and the DAG admin console is not reachable via localhost or the allowed IP. We’ve encountered this on 4 separate deployments when moving folks from QA/Inside to DMZ subnets after testing everything. Bindings are set to All Unassigned, we’ve tried binding it to the new IP, we’ve even gone as far as uninstalling DAG & IIS and re doing the whole install and even that doesn’t work. The DAG Admin page just gives us the old “page cannot be displayed” when hitting localhost/dag or fqdn/dag. When we uninstall the DAG from the server, we are able to reach the default IIS serving site. We resort to building a new server every time after backup the config.\n",

      "We have a Remote Desktop Session (RDS) collection with all of our servers running Windows Server 2016.\n",
      "We currently have Duo installed on our RD Web Access so that our users get prompted with Duo when they login to the web portal. This is not enough security for us. The web portal downloads .RDP files that log into our session hosts. A user could easily save an .RDP on their computer to log into for next time (or worse, an attacker obtains it) so that they bypass the web portal. Because of this, we either have to have Duo on our RD Gateway or RD Session hosts to prevent the web portal bypass.\n",
      "We have been trying out Duo on our RD Gateway but have come across into aHUGEissue. Our users are being disconnected after 8 hours, no matter if they’re active or idle. It seems like several customers of Duo have been experiencing this issue but the issuehas not been resolved since October 2018. Link here:Duo RD Gateway CAP/RAP Session timeout settings.\n",
      "A potential workaround is to install Duo right on our session hosts. While this would work, it’s extremely frustrating for our users to have to use Duo every time they open an application. RDS gives us the capability to publish apps into a “Work Resources” folder on the users start menu. When they click the app, it logs them into the server and opens the app. But when we install Duo on the session host, it asks them to authenticateevery time. Since this is not a web-based application, we cannot use the “remembered devices” feature. We also cannot use the “authorized networks” feature because all connections are being made come from the RD web access/gateway, thus appearing from an internal IP.\n",
      "Both of these options greatly affect our users and we don’t want to have to choose our poison. Does any one have any suggestions on how to implement Duo in an RDS environment that’s not invasive to users?\n",

I tried so many times to trigger it to allow me to do that until I saw my colleagues just put his finger on the fingerprint sensor. Oh duh! Right, for phones with additional fingerprint sensor that works, but where should I put my finger on to trigger that authentication?\n",
      "Sorry I sound so exasperated, but that’s how I feel right now. Can you image what it feel like when you are asked to authenticate multiple times a day, and have to type in really complicated password twice every time? Our company requires really long and complicated password to authenticate, and for my personal security, I put relatively complicated passcode (which is fine when I only need to type it them every a few days). But putting those 2 together, it is just a mess!\n",

We are trying to get auth, admin, and telephony logs to our SIEM (LogRhythm) prior to go-live. Since there is no connector/plugin for Duo that leaves the method of pulling the logs down via API and ingesting them as a flat file or csv format. I am aware of these resources for accomplishing this:https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logsandhttps://github.com/duosecurity. However, the team that operates our SIEM does not have a strong scripting background and this process will live on their platform. Are there more resources I am missing that could help them get this going?\n",
      "The fact that Duo does not provide a more seamless process, or does not put more effort into working with SIEM vendors to make it seamless, IMO is a major drawback of the product. Any corporation with any compliance or regulatory restrictions will need to have these logs ingested into a SIEM. This should not be a manual, custom process that is prone to human error.\n",

      "I was also wondering if it would be beneficial/possible to allow for more/better customization for the configuration of the existing OpenLDAP Synch.\n",
      "Here’s my current idea:Some LDAP implementations use a variation of the ‘groupOfNames’ objectclass for their groups. Some use groupOfUniqueNames, etc. but any ‘sane’ mechanism would still use a DN reference for their members.Customization of the following would provide to be useful:objectclass: groupOfNamesmember attribute: member (dn)name attribute: cnentrydn (why not use dn?) & entryuuid (wouldn’t this be redundant if you already have a dn?)a reverse (user based membership) lookup customization. For example, we employ a cn based ‘memberof’ Not that sane, but still unique, as it’s part of the group DN.\n",

Do I need to purchase SSLs for this, or would Lets Encrypt work or better yet, does duo proxy installer not bring SSLs with it?\n",

An AD security group was created and added to Duo to allow certain user accounts to bypass Duo 2FA when logging in to their VDI.  This part is working correctly.  We also have certain VDI that were configured to autologin to the Horizon client to access the shared VDI. The autologin credentials are specified via a VMware goup policy snap in on the Thin Client hosting the Horizon Client/VDI.  After enabling 2FA none of those shared accounts will autologin.  The settings are still present and the username is populated in the Horizon Client but not the password. This broke immediately after enabling Duo 2FA.  Our InfoSec team is claiming this has nothing to do with Duo but is a Microsoft issue.My question is - would it be reasonable to assume that once Duo 2FA was configured on the VM server, some security settings related to Duo no longer allow autologin to occur?I really don’t want to be wasting my time with Microsoft just to have them tell me what I already suspect, that it is not a Microsoft issue.Any experiences or suggestions would be appreciated!

This update contains a number of long-requested features, including support for custom attributes and significant performance improvements for both single user and full synchronizations.\n",

      "Performance improvements for single user and full synchronizations\n",

      "Custom attributes\n",
      "For directory syncs, Duo selects default mappings for attributes. However, customers sometimes have unique directory structures and may need to use different attributes for username (including aliases), email, or telephone. This could be due to legacy decisions from local Active Directory mirroring up to Azure Active Directory in hybrid mode. To accommodate the unique structures of our customers’ directories, our goal is to allow customers to configure which field they will use for username (including aliases), email, phone number, and bring on additional fields from Active Directory.\n",

      "Users seen: Total number of users that were processed in the sync\n",
      "Users added: Total number of new users\n",
      "Users removed: Total number of users removed\n",
      "Users modified: Total number of changed users\n",
      "Error reporting\n",
      "Clearer error messaging that helps provide direction on how to manage an error appropriately.\n",
      "More consistency between Azure AD and on-premises Active Directory\n",
      "For customers who use both on-prem AD and AAD, there will be greater parity in the experience.\n",
      "Updating to the new AAD sync\n",
      "All customers on a paid edition of Duo have access to this new version. If you are currently using AAD sync, you will need to reauthorize your sync after opting in to the new version.\n",
      "To utilize the new functionality and reauthorize your synchronization:\n",
      "Log in to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate toUsers > Directory Sync.\n",

We have DUO on multiple servers and one of the things we would really love to see is the ability to set up an “Offline” access to the server that is not tied to a specific person. For example, if we set up a Yubikey as an offline authenticator on a server, have that be available to anyone logging into that server in case of internet access not being available (say an Internet Outage).  It isn’t a huge deal but it is something that would make it nicer when installing DUO on servers, that instead of having X number of “offline codes” in the app for the various servers, if there was the ability to have a yubikey plugged into the server that could be used as an offline authenticator for anyone with the ability to login to the server when the internet is out.\n",

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Can Authentication Proxy insert an attribute, not just 'pass thru' Authentication Proxy None KNelson https://community.duo.com/u/KNelson 2019-06-18 Our scenario is we have network devices that we do DUO authentication for administrative access to the devices. This is generally accomplished via RADIUS by way of the DUO Authentication Proxy (DAP).\n",
      "The simplest configuration is to configure DAP with a LDAP for primary authentication and a series of radius clients for our various devices.\n",
      "This works great except for those devices that require the indication of an access level/role by way of a RADIUS-provided attribute (such as ‘priv=15’ or ‘role=sysadmin’). I can accomplish this when doing attribute pass-thru with RADIUS as the primary authentication but then I need to setup (in our Windows environment) NPS for RADIUS which is basically yet another proxy not unlike DAP itself. This creates another point of failure just to facilitate inserting the attribute required by network devices to assign the appropriate access.\n",
      "What I perceive as being ideal is the ability to have DAP insert/inject these attributes directly by way of some additional attribute for each device/group of RADIUS clients (like an ‘insert_attribute_1’ and ‘insert_attribute_2’ corresponding to a ‘radius_ip_1’ and ‘radius_ip_2’ so each client/group can receive the response independently of others as each device requires).\n",
      "Since there could be multiple attributes required, the value could perhaps be a delimited list (eg.insert_attribute=cisco-avpair= ”shell:priv-lvl=15“, cisco-avpair= ”shell:role=sysadmin“). I don’t have a complete understanding of all the possible options/variations on a RADIUS attribute so I’m not sure if this solution would work for all possible uses but I’m hoping smarter people could fill in gaps with relative ease.\n",
      "Is there another way to accomplish getting these attributes communicated to RADIUS clients when using LDAP as the primary authentication that I’m missing?\n",

      "I may be misunderstanding a few things here  and if so I’ll be pleased to be corrected.\n",
      "My main use case is to use 2FA for unix logins. So far this works well with the pam_duo module in a server’s pam stack.  The operation is simply that pam_duo pushes an approval to the phone.  But this is not quite U2F as there is no cryptographic relationship proven as part of the authentication.\n",
      "The strength of the Duo push process is in the proof provided by some biometric.  But this is still a level below U2F as a push is subject to an interception attack, before it reaches the device, isn’t it?\n",
      "Duo has long supported U2F via some token that contains cryptographic material to use.  I’m wondering if Duo has or is considering leveraging a smartphone’s TrustZone feature to store keys in order to effect U2F, rather than relying on another physical device?\n",
      "My own view is that I find USB tokens, attached to my car/house/etc keys a greater level of user friction than a smartphone biometric.  I find losing a phone less likely than losing keys and phones often  have the advantage of a remote control feature (eg Apple’s Find My Phone) that helps (disabling, locating, alerting) in such cases.\n",

We’re trying to setup Duo to integrate with our SonicWALL SRA 4200 and so far it is successful with the primary configuration using[radius_server_iframe], however I’m looking to have this work with NetExtender as well but that doesn’t seem to be working when using the SonicWALL SRA alternative configuration atSonicWALL SRA or SMA 100 Series SSL with RADIUS Auto Push for VPN Client Access | Duo Securityand[radius_server_auto].\n",
      "Our configuration is using[ad_client]for preauthentication, and the strange thing is that if a user tries to login with either NetExtender or the SSL VPN SRA webpage using[radius_server_auto]configuration, it will send a push notification to the user’s Duo Mobile app but nothing happens after that point. Before timing out, the user will receive one more push notification, wait a while, then the SRA webpage or NetExtender will return an error “Login server unreachable. Please contact your administrator or try again later.”\n",
      "According to theauthproxy.logit shows preauth was successful then it triggered a push notification. Then Duo authentication returned ‘allow’: ‘Success. Logging you in…’ and it sent the response. The log pretty much stops at that point but then it repeats this process for that second Duo push. The only error I see here is between the auth and preauth stage with the following line:\n",

      "(Note: “hostname.domain.name” is not the actual data in the log, I just changed it here for privacy.)\n",

I even went so far as to change the hostname to the SRA’s IP address, which gave me a different result in the log to the effect of “valid IP” but like I said, no change in the overall behavior.\n",

Protecting Applications forum None DZag https://community.duo.com/u/DZag 2019-09-09 Is it possible to restrict or reduce the number of links shown in the launcher by user group for items other than bookmarks?So in the Access gateway, you’ve got SAML applications, non-SAML Duo Web Applications, and generic bookmarks. You can set the Duo integrated applications to only allow authentication based on user group, but they still show up in the launcher to people who are not in that group. The bookmarks which are not duo integrated at all seem to be the only set of links that show up in the launcher that can be hidden per group.For example- we’re expecting only a few end user facing applications to go through the gateway, but dozens of IT specific ones. We don’t want it to clutter up the interface for end users but instead somewhat customize what they see based their needs.Is this something that i’m just not finding the config for? Or is it something that should be a feature request? Or is it a use case for multiple Access gateways- one for all users, and then another for back-end users?\n",

      "We are happy to share that the Duo Mobile app for Android will soon feature a dark theme. This feature will be available in Duo Mobile for Android version 3.29.0, which will be released on Tuesday, August 13, 2019. iOS users, don’t fret! A dark mode for the iOS version of the app is coming soon.\n",
      "As with many other apps’ dark themes, this long-awaited functionality is intended to make the app easier to use in low-light conditions and for users with sensitive eyesight. It can also help save battery life by illuminating fewer pixels.\n",
      "Here are a few screenshots to give you an idea of what this will look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "For devices running Android Q (10.0), which is planned to be released this month, it is dependent upon the “Dark Theme” setting located in the Quick Settings dropdown menu.\n",
      "Dark theme will be enabled or disabled based on the user’s system settings. On devices running Android Pie (9.0), whether or not it appears is primarily dependent upon whether the user has battery saver mode enabled. Note that only certain devices are firmware-enabled to support dark theme when battery saver mode is enabled and the system-wide “dark” setting in Android Pie has no impact on whether dark theme is utilized on user apps.\n",
      "Also included in version 3.29.0 of Duo Mobile for Android are some slight design tweaks to the general appearance of the app outside of dark mode. The color of buttons and backgrounds throughout the app will change slightly, along with the color and size of text elements. Here is an example of the “tweaked” look in the “light” or regular theme:\n",

      "Greetings. Curious to know if anyone is experiencing issues after logging into their respective admin portals for managing their Duo instances? This morning I have been logged out of our admin portal whilst navigating through it almost immediately after a successful login. Generally I am able to access maybe a couple of pages in the Admin Portal before being kicked out and presented with “***Your session timed out. Please login again.***” from our admin login portal. Our daily use web browser is Google Chrome Enterprise, and we are on the latest stable version (currently v75.0.3770.100 x64) on Windows 10 x64 v1803.\n",
      "My co-workers have also experienced the same. The issue does not appear to manifest itself if using Chrome in Incognito Mode, nor does it appear if using Firefox. Suffice to say we have not tried either Edge or IE11 on Windows 10.\n",
      "Thoughts, comments, suggestions? Thanks in advance.\n",

My main concern is that I’m going to need to come back in to Flow or in to PowerApps and re-authorize the connections frequently, which negates a lot of the automation efficiencies.Because connections are commonly created under normal user credentials I can’t disable MFA for those accounts, either. I thought about trying to track down the public IP’s that these services use, but even in the off-chance that I can find that info it isn’t a great solution since they’ll be subject to frequent change.\n",

Cloud None colohost https://community.duo.com/u/colohost 2019-05-03 Hi all, I’m deploying an open source app within Tomcat and it does not have functionality built in for any 2fa/mfa solution, nor SAML.  It does have the ability to do SSO via its container (Tomcat in this case).  We use Duo Access Gateway for SAML-based SSO to cloud apps, and ideally would do the same with this thing, so I was curious if anyone has successfully integrated Duo’s Access Gateway with Tomcat?  I have a rough idea that such an integration may be possible with Spring’s SAML gateway, but have not gone down that path yet.  Not as ideal, but another option, would be for me to do Tomcat-level active directory / ldap auth, but I’d still want to hook traditional Duo MFA into that, so I’d still need to figure out how to do that piece if that’s any easier than DAG/SAML+Tomcat.\n",

This has quickly become the bane of our working lives and has seriously impacted productivity.  It appears that weak connectivity means that Duo isn’t robust enough to consider that the connectivity isn’t there and instead times out, wiping out whatever progress you had from the app that initiated the Duo pop-up in the first place.  There does not seem to be any prior notification that a Duo Push is pending.  For instance, if I try to access my email ahead of time for an important client meeting t join a Skye or WebEx, this inevitably is when Duo gets all need and wants attention.

So far the documentation has been pretty much spot on and I’ve been able to install, configure, and use this with multiple users on a test CentOS 7.6 VM. I’m able to enable SELinux and configure it to allow for successfulsshlogins, but it seems to break local logins. What happens is that I enter my password at the local login prompt and it seems to hang for a few seconds, then it simply forgoes the Duo 2FA and logs me in. So, it seem to break in a bad way as itallowsthe login instead of denying it. As I mentioned,sshlogins as well assudo -icontinues to work as expected with SELinux enabled, but not local logins.\n",

I had experienced similar problems with FreeOTP which I had been experimenting with before. When I found out that my institution has a site license for Duo, I began to work on implementing my 2FA with Duo in lieu of FreeOTP.\n",

When NPS and RRAS are installed on the same box RRAS defaults to (and I don’t believe can be disuaded from) leveraging NPS for AAA.

For example, I have a policy on NPS for VPN users and another for network device admins. In NPS the radius client gets assigned a friendly name and then that name gets matched to a policy. Since the duo server is only one device then it gets mapped to a common friendly name on the NPS server which would always match one policy.\n",

The following is text I sent to the Duo support email address hoping to get an answer, but unsurprisingly in retrospect, they refused, since I’m not a customer. Hope someone can answer me here. I’m a staff member at a US university, who is a software developer, but not involved with the ITS org at the university that uses some Duo product (not sure which) as part of our central auth system (CAS). From here on I’ll quote my email, with minimal changes, so I don’t have to edit too much:\n",
      "At my university, we are using your product to integrate with our CAS to provide (among other things of course) the ability to do 2FA with Yubikeys. However the way the software is set up, I am required abuya new Yubikey 4 blank from our ITS. This is apparently (as I understand it) because the only way to register the Yubikey into the Duo software is to copy/paste code numbers that are emitted from the programming phase of the Yubico software.\n",
      "The problem for me is that I already have some Yubikeys and don’t want to buy new ones. I’ve been through a long back-and-forth with our point person on this end trying to get an answer to the question “WHY can’t I just REGISTER my existing Yubikeys in Duo?” Finally, after I met her in person and listened in detail to all the steps in the workflow, that I understood what I have mentioned above - that it seems the ONLY way to register a key is to program (or reprogram) it immediately before registering, so that the internal PKC codes can be pasted directly into Duo.\n",
      "If you are working in support at Duo, I’m sure you must understand that the concept of the Yubikey was never intended to be one in which you have adifferentYubikey on your keychain for each and every site that you need to authenticate to. The idea is that you can have just ONE, and use it with many different sites.\n",
      "In my (reasonably technologically well-informed) imagination, there shouldn’t be anything needed to register my existing key beyond plugging it in somewhere, being prompted to press the key’s button when it flashes, and…being done. This is how it worked when I registered my key withfastmail.com. This is how it worked when I registered my key withfacebook.com*. Those registrations both happened right over the web from my own PC. I hope you can imagine how frustrating it is for me to learn that it’s not just this simple when I want to use my existing key at work. Even if I need to travel in person to my ITS office to get a registration done, that is not a problem at all.\n",
      "Can you explain to me whether there is, in fact, a way to register my existing keys with whatever is the software product that my university is using, WITHOUT reprogramming them (which would mean that our ITS staff over here are insufficiently familiar with your software) or whether they are in fact correct, and there is NO WAY to register an existing key without reprogramming it?\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Edit: I have seenthis. But I can’t quite make sense of the fact that it says “Duo supports 3P OTP tokens”, presumably also pre-programmed ones, but still explains that you need to provide these internal numbers. My understanding is that these numbers cannot be retrieved from a Yubikey once it is programmed.\n",
      "* I suppose I should point out that my university is only supporting OTP, not U2F, and with facebook I’m using U2F.\n",

      "Currently, we have our Office 365 and another third-party application protected via Duo. As such, any logins to either application from our “trusted” ip addresses results in the Duo MFA prompt for a split second, then passing the ADFS login through as they are identified to originate from the aforementioned trusted network. Logins from outside our trusted ip addresses still prompt for MFA as expected.\n",
      "We now have a new vendor and application that we are able to tie into our ADFS login, but this application needs to be prompted for MFA for all logins (note, the vendor has our ip addresses white listed, so no logins are permissible from any other network).\n",

      "d) I  have configured the RDP server to support offline access.  It does work, but there is a 15 second delay, before the RDP session prompts for the offline access.  it seems to imply, that it is trying to communicate with the DuO servers and it then fails to connect and then prompts the user.  Is there a setting that can reduce this delay so it just displays the offline authentication straight away.\n",
      "It might be that the environment I have in a truly offline mode is not intended for the use of DuO, as the servers I am using are within a closed network with no internet access.  It might be plausible to place a proxy in, to  support the outgoing traffic to the DuO servers.  I would need to know about the target DuO environment, and look to implement further security controls to support the connectivity to the your servers.\n",

The 6.X built in workspaces client has the MFA input box on the same screen as the AD authentication.  I assume this would require the passcode to already be available before authentication takes place.  From my understanding is that DUO generates the code after initial authentication and prompts for the additional credentials on a second screen using the Desktop Client.\n",

      "Thus far, the policies I’ve crafted either blocks all enrollment access from internal or external sources, or allows enrollment from all sources.

      "I have an application that uses SAML to authenticate the user with Azure directory.  A conditional rule is then used to trigger Duo 2FA.  Then in my Duo portal I have a policy for the Microsoft Azure AD application which does not require trusted device, and allows SMS.  Despite this, on mobile devices it ALWAYS asks the user to verify they have Duo mobile installed (or prompts for a local certificate if they happen to have one), despite that trusted device isn’t reqiured.  The user can click the “I do not have Duo Mobile” and it lets them in.  Therefore, the check is trivial / theatrical.  Also, the SMS option does not show up.\n",
      "Is this behavior typical?  Is it a bug?  Or is there something in the JSON file for custom control that is saved on the Azure end which needs to be changed to support this?\n",
      "Sadly, the only fix is to disable Duo Mobile as a trusted endpoint configuration (as well as delete the local cert if you have one on your mobile device).

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity TLS 1.2 on Admin console Policy & Access Control forum None jrolfe https://community.duo.com/u/jrolfe 2018-07-12 Just received the email about the duo admin console not supporting browsers using cipher versions older than TLS 1.2. I appreciate the notice and transparency, but I gotta say I’m disappointed, Duo. The PCI SSC announced this requirement over a year and a half ago, and the deadline (which was already extended a year) for implementation was June 30, 2018. A security company I use and trust is just now implementing this on July 26, 2018 (being out of compliance for almost a month)? Those of us who take PCI seriously know how much effort and preparation may have been required for this, and the LONG time the council gave us to implement it. Don’t get me wrong, we absolutely love Duo and I will whole-heartedly recommend it over your competitors, but just some feedback that we’re disappointed in your lack of preparation and commitment to PCI. When your job is to help me be compliant (primarily section 8.3) and you yourself aren’t (section 4.1), it’s not sending a good message.\n",

The Payment Cards Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) recommends TLS 1.2 for all merchants who can collect credit card billing information. Because the Duo Admin Panel can be used for credit card billing, we have decided to adopt this requirement.\n",

      "I would treat the keys as “untrusted” since they are currently completely user managed.  Switching to trusted auth, I’d use AD as the first factor, and Duo as the second.  This ensures a quick cleanup of a newly departing user without having to go back and sweep up keys.\n",

What I’d like to see is a capability to log in with AD/Duo once and have that session live for x number of hours before requiring re-authentication.

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Nextcloud, LDAP, Duo Integration Help | Cloud None dcsteve24 https://community.duo.com/u/dcsteve24 2018-04-15 I have been battling nextcloud/duo for the past two weeks and am feeling beyond hopeless at this point. My bosses have given me a series of requirements: Get Nextcloud installed into our network, and integrate Duo onto it. We have individuals we occasionally contract out into SCIFs so Duo needs to play with the hardware tokens as an option for those that can’t push to their phone for 2FA.\n",
      "Some people may suggest using another platform in either department. My company is insisting on needing Nextcloud. It is a solution for large data transfers (to large for email) between our contracting companies that doesn’t require them needing accounts into our network. Duo is something we are to far invested into at this point to just start buying some other companies hardware tokens or to just swap 2FA providers. My company choose to go with them to meet 2FA for NIST reasons prior to me being employed and has it integrated in nearly everything at this point as well as purchasing their hardware tokens…\n",
      "My current setup is the Duo LDAPS Proxy which is working great except for 1 small factor. I log into Nextcloud with my Active Directory (AD) account which is configured to push to my DUO LDAP proxy. The Proxy authenticates to the Active Directory and if accepted, pushes to Duo for a auto-push or hardware token acceptance if the password had the delimiter. When user accepts (or if hardware token is correct) duo accepts and sends back to proxy which sends back to Nextcloud.\n",
      "This is all functioning correctly. The 1 small factor is that after I log in, it apparently periodically re-requests authorization. So I will be working within Nextcloud and all the sudden get a prompt for Duo from the LDAP proxy. It will not load the file/page until I accept. This leads me to believe that nextcloud is resending authorization packets periodically which triggers the whole authentication process again, and since the user has no option to add a delimiter on the auto authentication, it auto-pushes to the phone. Which is an issue for SCIF people. They can’t re-authenticate and therefore will be kicked off.\n",
      "Is there any way of configuring Duo to not push when Nextcloud sends the LDAP re-authorization until the user logs off or for XX minutes? I see that it can be done for web browsers if DUO played with Nextcloud (which i cant get it to hence the LDAP proxy route). Or is there a way to use the LDAP proxy for initial login and the actual AD for re-authentication requests?\n",

But if I leave that box unchecked, the login prompt for AnyConnect shows two username and password fields, and using the same username, the authentication works and I get the push notification.In fact, I even swapped the primary and secondary authentication methods to help narrow down the issue, and when I use DUO as primary and local auth as secondary, and I have the Use primary username option selected, I get the push notification on my phone, but the AnyConect login fails because the local authenticaion on the CIsco ASA fails.

[SOLVED] | Duo Restore forum None GwynethLlewelyn https://community.duo.com/u/GwynethLlewelyn 2017-12-06 Hi there! I use Duo Security as a 2FA single-use password generator forCloudflare. It has worked flawlessly ever since I’ve configured it… until today I upgraded my iPhone to a more recent model. After restoring everything from the backups, and while the Duo application correctly identifies that I use it for Cloudflare, since the original configuration was tied to the older iPhone, the new one requires anewconfirmation/registration.\n",
      "But CloudFlare, to allow any changes/modifications of the 2FA device/system that is tied to the account, needs some extra authentication… from the original device/system used to set it up on the first place… which sort of makes sense… unless, of course, you don’t have it any more!\n",
      "Other applications give alternative options to ‘reset’ the 2FA system in use, such as providing a QR code to scan, or a special sequence of numbers to reset the app used to generate the single-use code combination — or even, such as in the case of those applications using Duo Prompt (such as WordPress), you can even use the Duo Restore feature (which works like a charm in WordPress!).\n",
      "But sadly Cloudflare doesn’t haveanysuch choice on their backoffice!.. theonlyoption is to authenticate with theexistingDuo app andthenremove it to set up with a new one. It doesn’t even allow changing, say, to a competitor, and back again; once that session is expired, there is no way to get back in. That’s an egg-and-chicken problem: to change the ‘Get Working’ message on the Duo app, I need to reset CloudFlare’s ‘link’ to Duo Security; but to do so, I need to have theoldapp on theoldiPhone working (which, of course, it isn’t; the iPhone was already factory-reset and sent to another person…).\n",
      "So, is there an alternative way to I ‘force’ the ‘Get Working’ message on the Duo Mobile app to actuallyworkagain with Cloudflare?\n",

The prompt for Duo 2fa is very inconsistent.  There doesn’t seem to be a pattern with browser/OS.  We will get the ADFS Auth prompt but then no Duo prompt.  We are expecting that each time we have to authenticate we should get Duo, but we are not.  Has anyone else seen this issue?\n",

Our goal is to move everything we can to the cloud including our domain controllers (Azure AD).\n",
      "It seems DUO and Azure AD can only be used as secondary authentication and you still need a primary authentication to occur first? I’m a bit confused on how we can use DUO with Azure AD.

This conflicts with their setup instructionshere.\n",

I’m looking for advice whether I should since it doesn’t follow the Salesforce SSO setup instructions on the Duo site.\n",
      "I’ve also had issues opening community links and receiving the 404 error while I was already logged into my production org.

There is documentation from Duo located here:Duo Protection for Intacct | Duo Security. There is one thing to note that I did not see in the documentation, which occurred while setting up and testing SSO for Intacct: the “Federated SSO User ID” iscase sensitive. Now, I tested this with multiple users to confirm, as well as flipping back and forth between case sensitive and normal. I can confirm that Intacct requires that the Federated SSO User ID be exactly as it is found in Duo. Hope this helps someone else, as it set me back about a day until I sussed it out.\n",

I don’t want to give my users full SSH/shell access to the server if at all possible.\n",
      "I have installed pam_duo according to the guide on the Duo website (https://duo.com/docs/duounix), and SSH/sudo two-factor is working great, but I’m having trouble excluding the SFTP users from Duo.

      "https://community.duo.com/latest?order=activity Passing additional LDAP attribute fields to Netscaler for SAML/SSO Protecting Applications forum None pjd https://community.duo.com/u/pjd 2017-09-05 I’m investigating setting up Citrix Unified Gateway in NS 11.1 using Duo for 2FA.  Before setting up Duo auth, I used standard LDAP authentication, which allowed me to add an additional field (mail) for use with SSO logins to Citrix Sharefile.  Sharefile uses email instead of usernames for SSO login, so you can either have users log in with their email address, or you can use standard username and pass an additional LDAP attribute (mail) for SSO.  I was able to successfully set up SSO into Sharefile from the UG portal using basic LDAP authentication on the Netscaler.  Once I enabled Duo authentication, however, this ceased to work.  I realized that it was likely because the mail attribute was no longer being passed.  Reading some of the various setup guides I saw a parameter pass_through_all=true that I have added to my radius_server_iframe and _auto sections of my authproxy.cfg file to no avail.  Is there a way to pass that particular LDAP attribute using Duo login?\n",

Federal agencies and contractors use NIST’s standards as guidelines on how to secure digital identities.\n",
      "In 2003, NIST manager Bill Burr made up the now-infamous “best practices” for passwords, including complexity with regard to special characters, capitalization, numerals, and so on. He recently admitted he regretted doing so to The Wall Street Journal - as his suggestions only increased user frustration while having little effect on security. The new NIST guidelines recommend using long passphrases instead of complex passwords.\n",

We have purchased some Dell N2048P switches and I am in the process of setting them up.  I have setup radius within the duo web portal for 2FA and the push to my phone with the DUO app works fine and I get logged into the switch.  I am using [radius_server_auto] in the authproxy.cfg with client=ad_client.  My questions are:\n",
      "What line of code do I need to use on these switches to put myself in the Privileged EXEC mode when logging in?  I am having to type my local enable password after I get connected.  I have asked Dell Support about this and they say this is a function of the Radius server itself that allows this to happen.  I am guessing that I maybe add something to the authproxy.cfg to make this happen?  Their actual quote is:\n",
      "The rest of the configuration will need to be done on the RADIUS side, in this case Duo Security. With enable authentication set to RADIUS, as soon as the command enable is issued on the switch, it will then try to authenticate via the RADIUS server. If the RADIUS server is not configured to handle the enable scenario, then you will not be authenticated. I suggest contacting Duo Security, to see if they are able to accommodate enable authentication.\n",
      "Logging into into the web interface, I get prompted with the 2FA and I am able to get logged in.  However I get a prompt upon logon that says “Please note that you are a level 1 user and do not have configuration privileges.  This session is limited to read-only operations.”  Any help with this will be appreciated!\n",

We have servers in multiple domains, but user accounts share same username (e.g. MYCOMPANY\\johndoe, MYCOMPANYTEST\\johndoe, MYCOMPANYEXT\\johndoe) etc. I was hoping to set UPN suffixes for johndoe accounts across the domains to the the same value (e.g.johndoe@corp.mycompany.com) and use only one Duo account to manage all servers.\n",
      "However, it appears that Duo RDP software doesn’t use UPN and automatically prepends NetBIOS domain name to username, so requests to API look like “POST■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■:443/auth/v2/preauth?ipaddr=127.0.0.1&username=MYCOMPANYTEST\\johndoe” Naturally if my Duo username is MYCOMPANY\\johndoe, this will fail due to username mismatch as I’m trying to log into TEST domain.\n",

We have to provide the push, pass code, and phone options to our users due to limited cell coverage areas. We cannot protect the RD Gateway from non-Duo access since all anyone needs to do is configure an RDP session with the gateway settings and go directly to the RDP session w/o MFA. We direct our users to RD Web for access, but the single factor option is not hard to figure out.

      "Client in Windows 10, configured for L2TP with PAP and the secret key. When I try to connect I consistently get a 919, with no events on the server or entries in the duo proxy log file.\n",
      "The interesting thing is, if I set up the server and client to use a different authentication method, like MSCHAP 2, I get a different, more expected failure - I can see in the proxy log file that duo can’t process the password since I’m not using PAP and I do see Windows events showing that NPS rejected the connection.\n",
      "So when I consider both of these, what I’m thinking this suggests that L2TP is configured OK and my L2TP secret is correct … but I’m running into some kind of issue specific to PAP. Anybody else seen this? Do I need to adjust a security setting someplace to allow PAP on Windows?\n",
      "My read of the documentation is that PAP is required for this kind of setup. Any chance I’m wrong about that and there is a way to get a different authentication method to work?\n",

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) 3.2 went into effect in October 2016, with requirement 8.3.1 (expanded use of MFA) coming into effect on February 1, 2018. In the meantime, the PCI Council has come out with an MFA Supplement that sets forth some guidelines that may possibly be incorporated into the standard at some point in the future.\n",

After enabling debug mode in the Duo Remote Desktop Gateway application I can see even though we provide our UPN to RDG for authentication, the Duo Remote Desktop Gateway application log can only see an authentication request using our NTLM usernames-- which naturally we get “user must register” error thrown because it doesn’t recognize the username being non-UPN.\n",
      "I realize this is probably something that RDG is doing behind the scenes, but I can’t for the life of me think of where I could go to to fix this. At this point it seems our only recourse is to use Local AD Sync and retest everything on SAM/NTLM usernames.\n",

      "Unfortunately, while Slack does its best to keep up with Chrome, we’re usually a release or two behind. You’ll need to either whitelist Duo or disable / warn-only browser checks. We consider this an acceptable trade-off because Slack is not a general purpose browser (i.e. it’s not navigating tomy-cool-news.ru, onlySlack.com). We can mitigate security issues with our app on the server side by detecting and censoring malicious content (i.e. content attempting to exploit the desktop app) far faster than we can by shipping new releases of the Desktop app, unlike the General Purpose Web.\n",

      "One problem I have seen with “push based” authentication system without any challenge input, is that a fraudster could call the victim and say like “hey im calling from the bank, there is fraudulent charges on your account, login to your account and see for yourself”.The victim initiates a login, but at the same time, the fraudster also initate a login to the victim’s account at the same time.\n",
      "If the fraudster times this right, the Duo Push prompt will be for logging the fraudster to the account, while the victim thinks its for himself. And the victim didn’t do anything “wrong” security-wise, as the victim did as you should do, never follow any links or adresses a fraudster sends, but instead type the correct URL and login itself to verify if the information given, is correct.\n",
      "Why isn’t some challenge requested in Duo Push? It could be a 4 digit code on computerscreen, that the user enters into the mobile, in the Duo Push request to “Allow”. If the 4 digit code entered, does not match the 4 digit code contained in the actual push login request, the login request is automatically rejected. (because obviously, then its a mismatch between the push request and the session the user intends to authenticate).\n",

We are in the early stages assessing and integrating DUO into a test environment. We have a Test environment setup with a Domain Controller and a separate Dual Homed RRAS Server that is running the DUO Auth Proxy at present. I have created DUO account for testing and pilot implementation purposes and have followed the install instructions to successfully install and configure the Auth Proxy. I’m now configuring Server 2012 RRAS itself per the setup guide from Duo. I’m stuck at the point of changing the Authentication Method from the standard of Windows Authentication to Radius. The Domain Controller is a standard configuration running on Windows Server 2016 with the Domain level at 2012R2. On the RRAS Server (WinSvr 2012R2) , I’m logged in locally as a Domain Administrator, I’ve Opened the RRAS Configuration Management Module, Selected the RRAS Server properties per the setup guide instructions and moved into the Security Tab. The problem I’m facing is that the Auth Method List is disabled (Greyed Out) and I cannot change the Auth Type from Windows Authentication to Radius. This is not a DUO issue per sie but rather a windows config issue. I have been unable to find any info or other users also experiencing the same problems either in the support forums or elsewhere online, I’m confident I’m not the first person to have experienced this issue and wonder if you can point me at a note or info on resolving this problem. I’m at a loss as to why the Auth Method is locked in RRAS.\n",

We’re failing at the security fundamentals, and breaches are still happening, day after day.\n",
      "Part of the reason is, security was often approached as a bolted-on feature, added onto our systems as an afterthought - solutions like antivirus and firewalls alone no longer work to protect an increasingly complex attack surface with a disappearing network perimeter.\n",
      "Applying security after the fact isn’t helpful to protect against the same security problems anymore. That’s partly because we’ve moved from on-premises everything to a mass migration to cloud-based web applications. Our data and apps are living not only on infrastructure we own, but also on servers that we don’t own. We don’t know exactly who is accessing what, and how.\n",
      "Allowing access to these web applications involves two major components - verifying the identity of users accurately, and ensuring the security health of their devices. Ensuring their devices are secure has become a more challenging task, as employees are increasingly using their own smartphones, tablets and laptops to access work apps and data from remote working locations, from many different networks.\n",

To do this, Redis keeps a copy of data in memory to provide speed and on disk (this is important) to prevent data from being lost if Redis is restarted.\n",
      "Companies use Redis to store and retrieve data quickly and easily. Redis is intended to be used in trusted environments, and so it ships with a permissive security configuration, which is fine, unless you just put it on the Internet. That said, one of the fundamental laws of the Internet of Things is that if it can talk on a network, someone will put on the Internet.\n",
      "The issue is that we see many devices running Redis that are exposed to the Internet, which goes against the recommendations made by the Redis developers. Exposing Redis directly to the Internet allows attackers to view/modify the stored data. Even more importantly, attackers are able to remotely configure the Redis instance, which can lead to a complete compromise of the device.\n",
      "Duo Labs set out to measure how many Redis instances were exposed to the Internet and potentially vulnerable to attacks. Here is a brief summary of their findings:\n",
      "There are over 18k Redis instances exposed to the Internet, a vast majority of which are running an out-of-date version of RedisWe found automated attacks scanning the Internet trying to compromise devices running Redis with fake ransomwareEvidence of these attacks was found on 13k (72%) of the hosts running Redis, indicating that the hosts could be compromisedAfter setting up a honeypot to catch attackers, we recorded an attempted attack in just hours\n",

They also found that two out of three targets were hit multiple times. Bournemouth University reported they suffered a total of 21 different attacks throughout the year.\n",
      "It was also reported that the majority of universities suffered attacks despite the implementation of antivirus software, oddly enough.

General Discussion forum None mkorovesisduo https://community.duo.com/u/mkorovesisduo 2016-08-15 For years, many in the security industry operated under the assumption that breaches were inevitable - and our only option for breach mitigation is getting better and faster at detection, after they’ve already compromised us.\n",
      "The number of breaches are rising, because our security practices were created for a different time - a time when protecting the network perimeter was considered enough to keep the adversaries out.\n",
      "That’s why it’s time for a new security approach that focuses on prevention as the most effective form of protection. Instead of fighting against the consumerization of technology that has brought with it a new wave of user-owned personal devices to the workplace, Duo has embraced it, incorporating it into our approach to security.\n",
      "We want to enable easy access for your users and their devices by creating a frictionless security solution, while ensuring they’re free of known vulnerabilities at the same time.

Mikko Hyppönen, Chief Research Officer at Finland-based F-Secure, gave the keynote address at the event. He went into detail on the history and evolution of ransomware, including the state of ransomware today.\n",
      "An excerpt:\n",
      "infosec-europe-ransomware.jpg1024×624 76 KB\n",
      "What’s Old is New Again\n",
      "Essentially, old problems come back to bite us - that is, the kind of problems that we thought we’d already solved. One example is the AIDS Trojan discovered in 1989. It’s considered the early example of ransomware, which is now targeting hospitals, governments and enterprises alike.\n",
      "The software ranks you based on your risk of getting HIV. If it was installed without paying the license fee, it would overwrite your master boot record, encrypt your data and display a ransom demand to send payment to a P.O. Box in Panama.\n",
      "Similarly, Petya, a type of ransomware found in May 2016, infects your system, reboots, checks disk, runs and encrypts your files. Both old and new ransomware encrypt the master boot record and indexes, then demands ransom; however, the new one asks for bitcoin money transfers.\n",
      "[…]\n",
      "Studying Modern Ransomware\n",
      "Mikko mentioned that all of the many different ransomware types come from ransomware gangs that compete against each other. In his research, he’s tracking over 100 different groups.\n",
      "Each group is looking for a return on investment and new customers to infect to make a profit. In April, the first ransomware Trojan to target Macs appeared. This Mac ransomware scans your network looking for Time Machine servers, that is, it tries to locate and encrypt your backups.\n",
      "While Mac users represent a smaller percentage of users overall, there is no other ransomware competition in the market - meaning it’s a profitable one. As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin transactions are made public, and anyone can download the ledger to see the anonymized ransomware transactions that show online criminals are making hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Mikko.\n",

      "Wired also covered how some of the manufacturers reacted to our findings.\n",
      "As varied as their security stances were, the vendors also varied in how easy they made it to report security problems. While Lenovo, HP and Dell, all had direct channels for reporting security problems with their software, Acer and Asus did not, leaving Duo researchers to attempt contact to their customer support lines channels multiple times via email and phone calls before they got a response.\n",
      "How the vendors responded to the researchers also varied. HP has already patched the most egregious vulnerabilities the researchers found. Lenovo addressed its problems by simply removing the vulnerable software from affected systems. Duo reported the problems to the vendors more than four months ago, but Acer and Asus still haven’t indicated when they will fix the problems or if they will.\n",
      "“Asus told us they were going to patch in a month, then they backed off on that after we pointed out that their planned patch was also flawed,” says Steve Manzuik, director of security research at Duo Labs. “And that’s when our communication broke down with them.”\n",

Shovelware, crapware, bloatware, “value added” - it goes by a lot of names - whatever you call it, most of it is junk (please, OEMs, make it stop). The worst part is that OEM software is making us vulnerable and invading our privacy. Issues like Superfish and eDellRoot make us less secure and are often easy to abuse in practice. With that in mind, Duo Labs decided to dig in to see how ugly things can get.\n",
      "One of the major things we found was the presence of third-party update tools. Every OEM we looked at included one (or more) with their default configuration.
